>   The most widely known avatar of the Traveller was born to natural Kav elfar parents of Ironjade holdafast. He grew up mostly outside the holdfast, as a wandering minstrel. His birth name was “Waldann,” likely called after the Imperial Port town in eastern Lartroxia. Waldann chose to add the name “X” on his Ironjade naming day. Although there are legions of  [traveller](traveller.md)  regarding Waldann High-Ironjade X, the exact nature of his apotheosis is not known.

>   The traveller’s second incarnation was a Khannish woman known as Mary Maregaret Roadgrader, born to the warriors of the Plains of Tranodeli. She was said to have conjured up a strange chariot with which to build the Black Road.

>   In the Necrodemian Pantheon, the Traveller represents free will, musical invocation, but primarily is the deity of travel. 
>
>   The Traveller built a magical Black Road connecting most Imperial Ports, by which Necrodemian Citizens may travel throughout the empire inhindered by its political borders. He built a Road of Gold to ease travel between the domains of Necrodemain gods and goddesses.

>   The disposition effected by the Traveller is often seen as whimsical and unplanned. However, this does not mean he acts in a disorganized manner. 
>
>   Followers of the Traveller often enjoy their freedom to choose the unexpected path, and they tend not to pay siginficant attention to good or evil folk unless there is a great imbalance that oppresses a people’s freedoms.

>   The high temple of the Traveller is located at the end of the Road in Talismonde. Necrodemian clergy in good standing who know the ways of the Road are said to be able to find the path to the Gold Road while praying from the high altar in Talismode.

>   An elfar woman named Parker Shalenak represents the Traveller in the Magisterium of Necrodemian High Clergy. She is a private person, but is known to have excaped the Ironjade holdfast at an early age. She trained as a priestess to Waldann, and has resisted many attempts by Ironjade Kethi to return her to the back of their cave.

>   The Traveller represents all manner of folk, but shows favor to holdfast Kethi—and eyn-kethi.
