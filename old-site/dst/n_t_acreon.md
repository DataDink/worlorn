>   The Billykins World thief Acreon is said to have founded this guild with two other thieves who also steal all your gear if you are so foolish as say their names out loud. 
>
>   Acreon Superthief is said to have stolen the patella of Al-Bac. Sages of the Billykins  [dragonbones](dragonbones.md)  tell of a collection that was known as *The Armor of Acreon*. 
>
>   Acreon was known to be a very good thief, but not very good at keeping the stuff that he stole. Perhaps this is why his guild came to be run by Andromache and Hermione e’Helen. 
>
>   Acreon Superthief Guildhalls are all portable **Instant Fortresses** stolen from Daern of the *Class of ’79*, and therefore hard to locate.
