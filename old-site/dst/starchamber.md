the sanctuary of Mestea



 


 



 
The Star Chamber is one of the most incredible feats of technology and magic ever assembled. The Star Chamber is a vehicle that is capable of traveling virtually to any location, but often residing (archored) on the Astral Plane above  [mestea](mestea.md) . The Star Chamber is both a Sanctuary and Fortress, capable of harnessing the awesome power of the stars (cold-fusion being an example). 

 
From the Star Chamber, adventures could travel to any place, perhaps any time. The Star Chamber is the key for adventures who want to travel places they could not otherwise go. Seek  [niteblade](niteblade.md)  and he will take you there.

 
The Star Chamber is essentially Mobile Turf. Conceivably, The Star Chamber could travel to another turf , and thus, exist as a turf within a turf.

 
The Star Chamber is an impenetrable fortress, capable of inter-stellar, inter-planar, inter-turf, multi-dimensional travel and defended by the ultimate harnessing of the power of the stars. In fact, the Rune Stones are stars and be found within.

 
Niteblade can travel to and from the Star Chamber at his will, from any location.

 
Niteblade cannot die permantly due to the power of the StarChamber. At the moment of death, he and his equipment are instantaneously returned to the Star Chamber from where ever they are and restored fully to perfect condition. No one can claim Niteblade spirit, for Shal-Omnis has already do so and the Alter of Shal-Omnis is the focal point of this power. The alter also has the following powers:** **Resurrection, Regeneration, Healing, Restoration, Stasis Field (no aging while laying one it), Turns to Dust any non-believer/person who has fallen from grace, Wall of Force 10' around alter when believer is on it.

 
From the Star Chamber, Niteblade has a direct gate to Shal-Omnis. There are eight curtains which are act as gates to Niteblade's henchmen (A dragon, a male and female centaur, a male and female giant lynx, a male elf fighter, a human druid, and a human cleric). Another henchman (a pseudo-dragon) resides at the Star Chamber library.

 
From the Throne of Control, Niteblade can pilot the Star Chamber and harness its awesome power. The Eyes of Shal-Omnis allow Niteblade to scry undetected on anyone or any location, allows an ESP to the subject being viewed, and allows an Augury to answer any questions about what is being viewed. This is also the view screen of the Star Chamber.

 
There is a transporter (much like Star Trek) that Niteblade can use to transport others to and from the star chamber. For others, this is the only way into the star chamber and can be controlled only by Niteblade while setting on the throne.

 
Niteblade also commands the power of the **TRUE PLATINUM WISH GLOBE **which allows him to cast 1 wish per day without penalty. The Globe is empathic to a degree to assist in determining true desire. The Globe is made of true platinum (the rarest of metals).

 
One of the guardians of the Star Chamber is a Black Worg named Blade or just Dog. The Worg was obtained during a battle/test with three "FATES.' This Worg is a "Reflection of NiteBlade." The Alignment and General attitude is exactly as NiteBlade's. The animal is as a familiar except no HPs are received by NiteBlade. The animal will be loyal until death. They animal is empathy and will act as a trained attack or guard animal would. It has a MAGIC RESISTANCE of 25%.

 
The armory and treasury of the Star Chamber is vast, containing many various and unique weapons, works of art, treasures, and raw materials. The library of the Star Chamber contains lost and rare works of art and magic. One would have trouble finding a better library anywhere.

 
All items found with the Star Chamber belong to the church of Shal-Omnis, and thus, don't overtly violate restrictions place up Niteblade's Ranger class. In fact, you would be hard press to find someone who has tithed more. None the less, they are Niteblade's to use at his discretion.

The Arch-Angel of Shal-Omnis



 


 



 


  [niteblade](niteblade.md)  is the Dominator and Supreme within the Star Chamber. This is his solitude � his sanctuary. This is his fortress, his gate to Shal-Omnis.

 
To humanoids, Niteblade appears as a Royal Drow Male with a circlet of Gold upon his head, and is often dressed in finely made chain-mail. Niteblade is rumored to be kin to Dragons, perhaps even Dragon, however, no one has been able to verify this fact. What has been verified is that Niteblade is the King of the Yellow Rose, a unique, powerful, and ancient organization of DragonKnights. Niteblade is also the Arch-Angel Supreme to Shal-Omnis, the Deity of Dragons. 

 
Niteblade has not been seen on Mestea for some time. 

 
Niteblade believes in the freedom of choice and the upholding of life. He is the enemy of Morgonti weapons. Wielder's beware �

 
Niteblade has had many titles, including but not limited to the following: God, Demi-God, (both declined), Arch-Angel, King, Knight, Rangerlord, Chief-Protector, BodyGuard, MoonKnight, Leader of Chaotic Good, DragonKin, Brother, Husband, and Friend But Niteblade is not known for his titles, he is known for doing what is right and just, what is good for the world. Niteblade is the champion of freedom of choice and the freedom of life: He will defend to virtues to the death: even if he must remove those freedoms from violators of the code.

 
From the Star Chamber, adventures could travel to any place. The Star Chamber is the key for adventures who want to travel places they could not otherwise go. Seek  [niteblade](niteblade.md)  and he will take you there.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Star Chamber has a special connection to Mestea, being the home of Niteblade. Stars have a special connection to the Star Chamber.

 
The Star Chamber is detailed very well above.

**the high one** on the Star Chamber (the sanctuary of Mestea):

THE TOKEN FOR OIMOTA

 

</ins>
A token materializes, spinning freely somewhere between the elements, chaos, the void, and the turfs. The token pulsates with light and awesome power and potential. A voice speaks, "From the stars this Rune Stone came, it is a symbol to Worlorn, a symbol of eternity. As long as this star exists, Worlorn will exist � nothing can change that now." The Token melds with Oimota.

 Any turf that touches the Astral Plane can get to the Star Chamber. Anywhere the Star Chamber travels can have transitive congruency to the Star Chamber.  [mestea](mestea.md)  has a unique congruency to the Star Chamber. The  [goldroad](goldroad.md)  can get you there. Getting in is a whole other issue.
