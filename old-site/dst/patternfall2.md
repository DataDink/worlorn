 4-28-4494 (50 Necrodemus) Voidcastle 
Shayol (party leader) resumes dancing, with Wedge, Marisse, Almitra and Simon. We're with the Childeans in their "safe house". As we plan and re-equip, three stealthmasters come through a secret door from outside. They are surprised to see us. 


 Surprise segment 1: Simon "Color Sprays" them, Shayol hits one in melee (putting him down) but Marisse misses hers. Almitra **removes** the earth below the third. 


 Surprise segment 2: Almitra repeats her action, further damaging one. Marisse and Shayol attack the same opponent, both hitting. 


 Combat round 1: Standing opponent teleports away. Simon loots the downed opponent, then binds his wounds. Almitra **removes** the body from her pit. 


 The prisoner awakes. Simon says, "Simon says you will cooperate with us. Simon says your will tell us what your gear does." The prisoner says that his red amulet is a Werdna's amulet, his ring is a Snake wish ring, and his small pouch contains a Victor's knife, and explains its functions of each. On further questioning, he reveals that they intended to assassinate Lorellyn and Solthea, two female Childeans in the group, but were surprised by the full group. After further questioning to reveal their side's military plans, he is slain. It is noteworthy that he revealed that their side is led by and Elite stealthmaster. 


 The Childeans now know that this place is no longer safe, so they prepare to abandon this place while setting some traps. Wedge and Almitra both take a fully charged Staff of the Magi. All but Shayol become invisible; Marisse paired with Wedge and Simon paired with Almitra. Simon gives Shayol an emerald ring of reflection. 


 We retreat back out the city gate we came in, then circle around the city from the outside toward the main gate. This will allow us to avoid most of the opposing forces, and let us use the Gold Road to reach the place Simon desires to go: "I am drawn toward the center" he says. 


The walk takes over three hours. There are no significant encounters -- at one point we meet a party of Childeans, who let Shayol pass when he mentions Solthea's name. A few times, someone high on the city wall tries to magic missile Shayol, but the attack is reflected by the ring. 


When we reach the front gate, we see a lone man holding a pitchfork and standing facing outward, away from the city. He appears not to notice us as we approach the Gold Road. We all enter the Road, holding hands. Simon sets the destination: the chamber of the Pattern. 


 Simon's encounter: a lengion of kobolds. They loose their crossbows. Simon says "Llyr, remove them" and they vanish. Almitra **removes** any bolts in the air. 


 Almitra's encounter: a merchant train with guards. Simon says "Llyr, remove them" and they vanish. 


 Marisse's encounter: drow. Simon says "Llyr, remove them" and they vanish. 


 Wedge's encounter: a horse made of gold. Legends tell that it is a figurine that can turn into a real horse. Wedge picks it up, but Simon says "Llyr, remove it" and it vanishes :-(. 


 Shayol's encounter: a boat. Note: it is now proven that Shayol must take road encounters. Simon says "Llyr, remove it" and it vanishes. 


 We exit the road and find ourselves just outside the chamber of the Pattern, at the bottom of Kolvir. Note: Wedge and Marisse are still invisible. Simon explains that an iakhlu must open the door. Shayol goes to unlock the door, but from behind us Grayson says "I wouldn't do that if I were you." 


 Simon says, "Llyr, remove him" but nothing happens. Greyson shoots Simon in the right leg with his Luger (a gunpowder weapon!), and Simon goes down. Almitra opens her lantern and shines the redlight on Greyson; his stealthmaster jumpsuit freezes. Greyson speaks a **word** which we all hear, and vanishes. 


 Almitra **removes** Simon's damage. He surmises that Greyson must have used a non-Worlorn weapon, then again requests that an iakhlu open the door. Shayol opens the door. Shayol, Simon and Almitra enter the chamber of the Pattern. 


 As Shayol enters, his fire shield flares up and is subsumed by the torches in the room. As Almitra enters, Rib is compelled to declare the **name** of the being entering; she names "Rib", then quickly exits. 


 Something Simon does brings the emerald ring back to his hand, and a Throne appears to his right in the chamber (not on the Pattern). Shayol notices a black doll suspended from the ceiling by a hook in a corner of the room. A man with Troy's visage (Oberon) appears in the center of the Pattern. Simon walks toward him, straight across the Pattern. As he crosses it, its blue flames rise up around him. All his gear vanish, revealing the mirror-finish Wrathman suit he was wearing beneath it. At that point, Marisse loses her "familiar" link to him. 


 As Simon advances, Oberon begins to retreat. Simon says "Simon says Oberon will remain where He is." 


 Almitra **wishes** "I wish Threnody were here" using Threnody's wish ring. All torches go out as he appears, and he lands as if he had just fallen on Almitra from a great height -- she is damaged only slightly, but Threnody is gravely wounded. 


 Threnody rises, then begins running away up the staircase. Simon says "Simon says Threnody will come into the chamber" with no effect. Oberon explains that Simon's effect won't cross the threshold of the chamber. Almitra heals Threnody by "withholding" the chaos of his injuries from him. After he is out of sight around the bend of the circular staircase we hear him stumble, then continue running. 


 Simon says "Simon says, Mother come in here please". Almitra re-enters. Simon: "Mother?" Almitra: "Yes." Oberon studies Almitra. Simon says "I would like you to turn this room into Chaos, please, including everything in it." At this, Shayol bolts from the room! :-) 


 Simon says "Simon says Oberon will remain exactly where He is." Almitra ssks Simon "Did Oberon destroy you by fire?" Simon responds, 


```
    He drove the car for the bank robber.
    He slew the doctor who would have saved my life.
    He let the drunkard buy the alcohol.

```

 Almitra makes no response. 
 Simon says "Simon says, Oberon Lord of Reflection will accept the Chaos from the Mistress of Chaos." Almitra opens her Lantern, takes up her Aspect and wields her Attribute, and with the full power of her Chaos Turf turns everything within the chamber to Chaos. All Turfs and Trojan powers are aware that something has happened; the repercussions will be "reflected" in all things of Trojan nature in Worlorn; the current Compact, the Book of the New Day, is high-probability **broken** as of this instant. 


 Almitra reforms herself from the Chaos, back in Llewghund. Simon within his (now slightly damaged) Wrathman suit is not **perfectly** protected, but his fate is not yet known. 


 Outside the chamber, Remo approaches and nods to (invisible) Wedge, then closes and relocks the door. He nods again as he leaves up the stairs. Wedge has to restrain (invisible) Marisse, who reveals that it was Remo himself who "punished" her, and she wants revenge. 


 Wedge quietly calls Yama's name, but He is apparently unable (or unwilling) to open His mirror here at this time. Shortly afterward, Almitra summons Shayol, Wedge and Marisse back to Llewghund (along with their gear). We all end in Llewghund in the late afternoon of 4-28-4494 (50 Necrodemus).
