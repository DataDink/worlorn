>   Xcalis Regence I founded the Stealth Master Battle School, but the master strategan was  [ender](ender.md) , who taught many students before he was  [morganti](morganti.md)  by one of them. 
>
>   All Stealth Masters are humans taken at pre-pubescent age and trained in a special blend of the non-magical combat arts of the fighter, thief, assassin, and monk. Special attention is paid to teaching historical perspective of the strategies and tactics of war. 
>
>   The highly secretive Battle School teaches stealth masters in armies of twenty, usually divided in four ’toons. Armies are fiercely loyal to fellow soldiers, even in later life as adults in the real world. Many of the Great Lords and three swords in the Cycle of Dance started their careers as stealth masters. 
>
>   There are nine ranks of training. Initiated into the stealth master ranks as Harmless, a student passes through ranks called Mostly Harmless; Average; Above Average; Competent; Dangerous; Deadly; and finally the most accomplished and talented stealth masters may become Elite before they are fourteen years old (subjective). 
>
>   Those who attain Elite can found their own stealth master armies. Most armies are named after animal totems, but a handfull are named after elemental forces.

>   The *iahklu* Marlee and *er-per’henne* Alai were notable students of Ender. Greyson was a student of Alai. 
>
>   Although the stealth master art is forbidden to non-humans, diGriz began his career in a stealth master army, and it is known the Army of the Rat is comprised of four mutant turtles. A Childean Phoenix Army was rumored to exist but you’d have to ask Marlee whether she thinks such blasphemy could be true.
