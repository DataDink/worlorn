 A little belated, but... 


 My knowledge of Roland was always sketchy. He is somehow related to the Demonlord -- in fact, when he left Hissarlik he took the same name as the Demonlord. He has special anti-lawful powers, something like the powers Eressea has over Ground. His home was at the South Pole. I'd hazard a guess that he was evil; he certainly was someone to be wary of. None of my characters ever knew him personally, so maybe he's really a nice guy. If Chrysofar's looking for someone who can make things happen outside the normal rules, Roland may be her man.

 Roland says he is * Looking forward to profitable meetings. Some would say Roland is a cold, brutal, unstable, psychopathic, paranoid, sarcastic killer. Roland would say "I am not sarcastic ." He is trying to learn the art of subtlety. *

 Roland casts his attention forth from the Forbidden Isle: 


 * I would also like to spy on Nightblade, Chrysofar, and Erin. One at a time. * 


 Niteblade is at Dolbadarn with Threnody, Vlad Tollenkov, and a sentient companion "Realorin" who is aware of Roland. Realorin nods in Roland's metaphorical direction as it prods Niteblade to awareness. Niteblade is interrupted from a conversation with the Blood Phoenix about crowns of might and elder titans when Roland turns his attention to Niteblade. Threnody smirks as Roland is noticed. Tollenkov is utterly clueless. Eressea is awakened. 


 Realoran makes certain that Chrysofar is aware that Roland was spying on Qniteblade, too. "Bummer, isn't it?" says Threnody to Roland. "You might just think Sentient Realoran was waiting for you since Musquel, wouldn't you just?" Realoran frowns at Threnody, who continues to smirk shamelessly in his item-granted dream-competence. 


 Realorin's assistance is superfluous. Chrysofar is aware of Roland's direct attention instantly and unavoidably due to a certain ambiguous symmetry they share. 


 Chrysofar is at Diaspar. The fellow Chrysofar is with, Tanngrisner (yet another damn incarnation of Roland's first god Troy Ounces) pays learned dream-competent attention eagerly towards Roland. Contact. First Tanngrisner appears both shocked and brokenhearted, then he shields himelf and Chrysofar from Roland's (and Realorin's) awareness. This shielding is invoked perfectly, but for a finite duration. 


 With this act proven to be in Diaspar at this time, near-Sentient Morgan la Faye becomes aware of the intense dreaming activity. "Oh hey!" says Threnody, as he returns his attention swiftly to the mundane within Dolbadarn.

 So now it's "let's go to the South Pole and take what some else has created." Gee, some idiot phrophesized it so it must be true. Well, if you must come, be forewarned. It will be beyond your worst nightmares and fears. There will be much blood and soul shredding and death and drek and creatures with nasty pointed teeth. And then when you actually make it to the Pole..... well that remains to be seen. I don't recall putting this real estate up for sale, but then again I'm not a theiving elitist kin. No offense Hektor. Let's do lunch.
