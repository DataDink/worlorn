# dust in the wind



 life

```
		
Turf holders, please join me in stopping the Dust Bitch. With your help I
wish to take the following actions:
(1)all DUST that falls on the EARTH is automatically Reborn. 
(2)all DUST that falls on the WATER is automatically Reborn.
(3)all DUST that falls in a SANCTUARY is automatically reborn.
(4)all Dust that falls on the Road is automatically reborn
We must always remember how precious and holy the gift of life is to
ourselves and all of our minions.
I further do decree : Rebirth in all it's forms is withheld from Chrysofar,
Last Defender of Troy and all her minions.
Holy Blood Phoenix 
Blacksword
