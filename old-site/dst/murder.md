# a murder of crows

>  It is cold, the coldest thing ever colder than the popsicle they got Gorodish with, she pulls at it as it pulls at her, as it sucks and sucks at her and she screams and screams and screams. Sick and wrong, not pain, a thing so far out past pain that it is not recognizable as anything at all but sick and wrong, sudden, out of the blue and into the black. The arrow's head, raping her chest. She vomits, dark hot gouts of her own blood. Taste like copper coins. Falling, her screams broken glass tearing her throat, the sound of her companions' screams falling with her and that sound suddenly the measuring stick of feeling and now it *is* pain, it is enormous, it is bigger than her whole body and her senses flee before it 

> (getitout get it out no pulling me no god cold help god anything
>     please no more let go I don't no I'm not come on let me live

 She is almost unconscious for a moment almost thankful but then humiliation, rage out of nowhere like a clean wind and her hands grope at the arrow, her hands move it and the pain sends her back screaming. She wrenches at it. A thousand arrows pierce a thousand chests. It moves in her hands, it wriggles like a puppy as it feeds and the obscenity is too much, something in her snaps, the backlash hot and dark under her skin and welling out through every fiber, every nerve, every twist of thought and the temperature soars a million degrees as horror burns into anger 

 (NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

>     NO  NO  I  WANT  MORE  LIFE  FUCKER  I will not let you you

 The Fire Sermon is in her hands. She has no memory of drawing it. Pommel in one hand, blade in the other and she slams it down onto the shaft of the arrow. Madness, sick agony, her own guts tearing from the force of the blow. The shriek of betrayed flesh. She screams now with the voice of an eagle, nothing human in the sound and the sword slams down a second time. Again shrieks. Again strikes. Something actually rips loose in her throat and her vision goes red. Blood red. The world, red 

> (NO  you think you get to have me you're wrong you're gone you're
>     destoyed don't even know it give it up NO I WON'T LET YOU belongs to me
>     fire I won't go you can't make me FUCKED WITH THE WRONG GIRL IT'S ME
> 	

 Light dimming as *things* are torn from her. Moments. Memories. Days. years. Torn away. Sucked down 

> (NO IT'S ME

 With each one something draws more taut within, a thin red line, a note rising, a razor's edge, passion, dangerous, inimical. She strikes again 

> (IT'S ME

 The sounds from her ruined throat are bestial now, impossible. She strikes 

 again 

> (NO

 Fading, ending, thoughts inchohate, uncoupled from reason, will out beyond words now, and at the center a burning insoluble passion that is a critique of power 

> 
>     (NO
> 	
>      NO
> 	

 Fading. Gone. Into the black.

>     (A voice, faint)
>     "Can ye not see that little light up there?"
>     "Where..."
>     "There!"
> 	
> 	
>     (A second voice, fainter but clearer)
>     "You should make the night, but see, you're little light's alive..."
> 	
>     "Over here..."
> 	
> 	
>     (And another voice now, inhuman, a voice that is many voices, loud, 
>     outraged)

>     YOU  WON'T  BURN  YOU  WON'T  BLEED  
>     CONFESS  TO  ME  GIRL
>     GO  DOWN

 And Melisse is there, naked, in a snowy field, vast, white, featureless, thin white-blue sky above and then moving towards her blackbirds, many blackbirds hungry, gloating, ready to tear but SHE is ready now, at last, a torch is in her hand and she sets her bare feet wide apart in the snow as the first one drops toward her. She swings her torch and the bird EXPLODES, flames and is consumed. She laughs aloud as the others circle, wary now but still hungry, talons out and beaks cruel but she moves like fire and if a blackbird comes too close, a blackbird flames. She holds the birds at bay. Another comes too close and is gone in a flash. Destroyed. 
>
>  The torch has burned down now, close to her hands, it is searing her flesh, her hands are on fire. Fine then, good. Let it all be fire, the ghost of a thought across her fever-bright mind. Never felt the fire, never had the chance, never got the chance. *Ordinary pleasure torn to pieces. Ordinary seventeen in pieces.* Well, let me burn this once. It will have to do. Tears on her face for her gone girlhood are streaks of flame, droplets of fire. Her hair is on fire. Her hair IS fire. SHE is fire. Fire is in her skin, her bones, it is her breath. It runs down her arms, her breasts, between her legs. She raises her arms to the swarm of birds and her hands are hands of glory, burning white. She reaches for a bird with her angry white hands. Squeezes it. It bursts, flames, is gone. She reaches for another. And another. Fury in her heart like the taste of a knife, clean, white burning. There are so many. Burn. Burn them all. Shrill deadly cries and drifts of black feathers blazing white and being consumed. 
>
>  Two come at her at once now and she catches one in each hand. As they flame something moves deep in her and she cries out:
>
>  “*That one's for you, Morin!*”
>
>  And though she does not understand her own words at all she laughs with joy, with triumph.
>
>  She is losing her shape to the fire. She struggles to hold some shred intact as the birds mob her. There are still so many. Getting tired now, so tired. She catches another, looks at it for a moment. Blackbird eyes. The thing about those eyes, they're flat and lifeless, like a doll's. They glitter when the light hits them but they suck that light up when they look at you. She crushes it. 
>
>  She is fading now, fire dying. Exhausted. Perceptions take on strange new colors as she struggles to catch just a few more, just one more. Something flickers at the edge of her field of vision. Off in the distance, on the horizon. The fire of her mind gropes for a name to shape it with. A fox? A fox. Standing still, watching, head and tail drooping down. Naming it strikes an incomprehensible chord of sorrow in her and she drops to her knees. I'm sorry, she thinks. So sorry. I tried. She is crying again, tears of fire. The fox turns and runs into the distance. He's gotten hard to carry, she thinks, and I've run out of love. Carry him for me, 'cause I don't know what he needs. It isn't here. It isn't here.
>
>  She struggles to her feet one last time but the remaining birds are scattering now, fleeing in all directions. Her fire is dying. She collapses again, suddenly terribly weak and for the first time, cold. Something, moving, she looks down and at last sees the bird at her breast, it's wings dark with her blood, it's beak in her heart. She brushes at it, weakly, and it's wings flutter. 
>
>  I tried, she murmers as the last of her flames flicker and she begins to slip into the dark. I tried so hard. I don't want to go.
>
>  She crosses her arms over the blackbird, with the last of her strength. squeezes it tight. As It and she dissolve into white, she thinks maybe she hears a voice- hers or someone elses, she can't tell- saying something, about love, about hating well, about how maybe way down deep enough love and hate are the same thing, but she is too tired to listen. She slips into the black.
>
>  Out of the blue and into the black.
>
>  *You did well, girl.*
