# damon eternal



dwarf-god maker, nightmare of champion

 Damon rumbles round a back storeroom, mumbling and muttering to himself. Shifting items about haphazardly, with little care to the items which have been piled here. An outsider would find them priceless treasures, many a greedy heart would be tempted, but to the Dwarfgod, they're just trinkets with little use to him, mostly just magic stuff he wouldn't even know what to do with. 


 "I know I left the blasted things 'round here somewheres..." 


 At last, in a back corner of the room he finds the elaborately worked platinum box. "THERE it is!" he says with some satisfaction as he blows the dust off it. "Hmmm, needs polishin' " 


 He goes back to his room with the box, where he opens it cautiously; with movements as judicious as the heavy stone fingers can manage. It is as if he expects some monster to spring from it, in fact he would have been more at ease with a nice viscous trap to confront. Open at last, the box reveals nothing more dangerous than a stack of painted cards. 


 He rapidly sorts through them until he finds one near the bottom. He frowns, not really sure about using the powerful magic. He tries holding it lots of different angles and ranges, at last settling on holding the card at arms length and eye level as he stands uncomfortalby in front of it. 


 "Uh... er, I mean.... uh Wedge? You there?" Then under his breath, "Blast, Threndy said this'd work..." 


 Louder his gravelly voice calls, "Uh, Wedge! I dreamed of ya! An' I saw where's ya took Threndy. I think maybe you better take me there too. I got sumpthin' for the Deathgod." He quickly glances at the golden bowl. "An' I think Threndy needs some help. Threndy's been a pal, 'n I wanna help th' elf." At last he shrugs and puts the card back into box with the others. 


 He picks up the golden bowl and turns it slowly round in his hands admiring the nifty design he put aournd the inside of the rim. For a moment a frown or scowl clouds his granite features, he still doesn't understand why his elven scribe turned white as ghost when he saw that nifty design, but in a moment the breif dismay has fled and he is once again fascinated by the bowl's elaborate engraved pattern.

 Wedge assists Damon, guiding his Holy Entourage to the Ziggurat known as Ironcastle. 


 It is much different travel than with  [threnody](threnody.md) . The entourage of dwarves is boisterous, funloving, and enjoy making noises at all hours of the day or night. The men and women of the Dwarven party are with life as children with a new toy. They are a young race, and this second generation remains more engrossed with the lust of living their lives fully than Threnody appeared in his quiet brooding. 


 There are times  [wedge](wedge.md)  forgets the destination as the days go by. The Dwarves are as a conucopia of medicine for the wounded soul. He takes page upon page of notes for drinking, fornicating, and fighting songs. Three weeks pass and there is only one sobering event on the adventure. 


 Wedge and Damon learn an important thing; dwarven clerics are NOT turned to blood with Threnody's  [redlight](redlight.md) . 


 Barshette, the Priestess who makes this discovery alternately laughs and crys for three days after she let herself forget what time it was while bird watching a rare species of eagle. The party is hard pressed to keep up the happiness in the face of Barshette's derangement, but meets the challenge admirably. There is singing at night and on the marches, and if the volume increases sometimes to cover her wails, no one comments. 


 Damon for three nights cradles her to sleep, crooning lullabies and quieting her moans with kisses like rain, so the others may rest. She holds him tightly, bruising his flesh, but the god Makes not to notice. Wedge takes notes for another sort of song and story, and feels ashamed. 


 Barshette recovers her spirits the fourth daybreak. That evening the other holy ones end all pretense and do not bless their tents or make sure the camp is established by 6PM. The nervous laughter is over by 6:02PM. 


 The party makes excellent time after this, covering twice the ground as expected by travelling for 14-18 hour days. The Dwarven party camps outside Ironcastle on Summer Begins of the Year 85 Necrodemus. They agree to remain with Wedge outside forever, until Damon is done with his tete-a-tete with death.

 Damon enters the throne room with a cautious look to left, then right. Spotting  [roland](roland.md)  at Yama's introduction he squints at the man for a long moment, then grunts. "Well met, Roland..." 


 Finally, his gaze returns to the  [deathgod](deathgod.md) . "H'llo Deathgod. It's been a long time. I ain't much fer Makin' speeches. I let muh work speak fer me," as he pulls the large golden bowl out of his pack. "I made this fer ya. On account a ya having been kilt 'n all, an' o'course mostly cuz I heard ya was alive agin." He hands the Deathgod the simple, shallow bowl, with the odd design around the inner lip. 


 "Oh yeah, 'n also cuz ya was nice 'n let me go on about things last time I saw ya, even though ya took everyone else off ta the Paths. I didn't really know what a Deathgod might need, but I figures even if'n ya don't need this here bowl, it'd go nice on some altar somewheres." 


 As Yama examines the bowl, he realizes that the elaborate design is, in fact, an elaborate script. A fact which Damon seems to be oblivious of. Nevertheless, it reads: 


```
"I wage not any fued with Death
  For changes wrought on form and face;
  No lower life that earth's embrace
May breed with him can fright my faith
Eternal process moving on,
 From state to state the spirit walks;
 And these are but the shattered stalks,
Or ruined chrysalis of one.
Nor blame I Death, because he bare
 The use of virtue out of earth;
 I know transplanted human worth
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.
For this alone on Death I wreak
 The wrath that garners in my heart:
 He put our lives so far apart
We cannot hear each other speak."

```
