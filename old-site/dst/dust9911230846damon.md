So fer... I ain't been talked to by Blood er Dust either one. So fer they ain't
made a case why I should care one way or t'other. Pawn? Might be... But since I
don't care 'bout the game, I don't mind s'much that they think o' me that way. I
don' think all that highly o'them, neither. This could change. You want to Make
a Change? Make things Right? Make someone Sorry? Make it up to Someone? Step up
an' state yer case. I'll think about it. Granted, thinkin' ain't m'strong suit,
but I'll give it a try. Otherwise, stop yer belly-achin', sounds like my Dad cen
beat up your Dad.

it down fer scrap. Make a New One.
