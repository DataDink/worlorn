 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The first Prince of Wallachia legitimatized thieves guilds as a commercial organization within the Necrodemian Empire. After his passing it has been said that Vlad Drakulya Tepes was also the first Upright Man. This was also said of his son, but only after his passing. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  To prevent abuses, on pain of disbanding a guild chapter and executing the tresspassers, a lawful thieves’ guild must retain a piece for a full day and a full night after its theft to grant the the most recent previous owner a chance to bid against the comissioner of the theft for possession of the controversial object. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, no guild is required to inform a previous owner that an item is for sale, at what location, or at what price. These facts are invariably provided as courtesies by the Upright Men, and on occasion also provided by other guilds as well.
