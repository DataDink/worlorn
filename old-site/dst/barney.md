 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "I did not know of Barney's Nightmare when we created Novus Mundi. This 51st Illithid may remain unslain in Worlorn since creation, which means a chance exists that it maintains the Wathan of the original Demonlord. It may be that both Iahklu and *er-per’henne* may be reborn from the Nightmare of Barney. Since Sentient Deatherage compromised his other existing Dreams to forgo Puk's Real Death, Sentient Deatherage is unable to claim Barney's Nightmare after Barney's death."
