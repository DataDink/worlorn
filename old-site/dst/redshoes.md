Oh she move like the Diva do
I said "I'd love to Dance like you."
She said, "just take off my red shoes.
Put them on and your Dream'll come true
With no words, with no song
You can Dance the Dream with your body on
And this curve, is your smile
And this cross, is your heart
And this line, is your path
Oh, it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be.
But it's gonna be no illusion
Oh, it's gonna be the way you always Dreamt about it
But it's gonna be really happening to ya
Really happening to ya
Really happening to ya"
Oh the minute I put them on
I knew I done something wrong
All her gifts for the Dance had gone
It's the red shoes, they can't stop Dancing, Dancing
And this curve, is your smile
And this cross, is your heart
And this line, is your path
"Oh, it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be.
But it's gonna be no illusion
Oh, it's gonna be the way you always Dreamt about it
But it's gonna be really happening to ya"
   She gotta Dance, she gotta Dance
   And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off
   These shoes do, a kind of voodoo
   They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off
Feel your hair come tumbling down
Feel your feet start kissing the ground
Feel your arms are opening out
And see your eyes are lifted to God
With no words, with no song
I'm gonna Dance the Dream
And make the Dream come true
I'm gonna Dance the Dream
And make the Dream come true
   She gotta Dance, she gotta Dance, yeah!
   And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off
   These shoes do, a kind of voodoo, yeah!
   They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off
   Call a doctor, call a priest
   They're gonna whip her up like a helicopter
Really happenin to ya
Really happenin to ya
You gotta dance.
You gotta dance.
You gotta dance.
