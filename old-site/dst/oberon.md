# oberon



god of reflection, king of shadow

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **oberon** is troy ounces after apotheosis: a lawful god of reflection. his aspect includes reflective thought as well as mirroring. his attribute is an emerald amulet.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) he appears to mortals as a negroid male human dressed in immaculate white robes and floppy hat. the only non-white clothing he sports is a 19-foot scarf, made of ether and moonbeams.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) oberon rewards reflective thought prior to action, and is displeased by reactive or impulsive behaviour. oberon prefers his followers to think for themselves regardless of tradition and authority. oberon demands followers take responsibility for their own actions. it is better to fail oberon than to defer blame.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) he displays spellcasting ability as 55th level magic user/illusionist, using his magic to speed people invisibly into a fate of their own construction. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) oberon's sanctum was a great hall of mirrors, which the most faithful could master for great reward. imperfect minds could gain partial powers by following a pattern on the hallway floor instead of confronting their reflections. oberon's hall of mirrors was reduced to chaos by almitra almustafa, greatly diminishing oberon's power in worlorn.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) if events allow oberon's avatar to aid-by-example in physical combat, oberon fights with a copper scimitar or openhand as a master of spring. in combat he becomes engulfed with green flame, which acts as a fire shield to reflect double the inflicted damage on oberon's attacker. magical attacks on Oberon are befuddled to reflect on the caster sevenfold, regardless.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) oberon's avatar carries the staff of caronus (staff of conjuration with time travel), and a glass dagger (glass-steel, all detection spells, invisibility, and otto's irresistable dance upon drawing blood).

 
#### tanngrisnir on oberon

 Oberon is a clever jokester. There's a bit of history between Threnody and Oberon that neither is telling.
