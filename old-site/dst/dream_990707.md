 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  In Salt Peter's Estate at this time, no chance exists for Sharra Decameron to surprise you. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  She appears in the foyer with a pop, as usual, and sways back and forth, most unusually. Perhaps she is not yet used to the crutches? Perhaps not. A chance exists that she is lighthearted from lack of blood? You think not, and it is so. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Where is  [maja](maja.md) ?" she asks you directly, albeit with eyes closed. She is not swaying any longer, but instead stands with left foot firmly planted and crutches slightly wider than her shoulders, grounded about a pace in front of her foot. Her right leg ends in a bandage, where her ankle used to be. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance exists that you know where the shearjashub of Maja Barusse has gone, so you beckon Sharra with a finger motion. It is a moment before she opens her eyes, but it is a moment of victory, of sorts. She sees your gesture and begins to follow without reprimand, since the chance exists. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You wend your way through the guests and servants to the top of the stairwell. You pass the Dark Angels, who are following the lost honor of their clan. You pass the dead elf who lives; he seeks to regain his honor. You pass the old women from the tall place, more concerned with living well than with their honor. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  At the top of the stairwell, you point downwards, and a chance exists that Sharra descends before you. A chance exists that she will not be conscious of you behind her. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  At the bottom of the stairwell, Sharra pauses to peer into the cave of Ground. It is a sphere Removed from the dirt and Protected by Ground and the Blue Star. Four torches, burning blue, are ensconced halfway up the curved walls at each cardinal point. The shearjashub of Maja lies with her body relaxed against the curved wall opposite the entrance. She blinks and smiles. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Welcome home," she says to Sharra, and Invites her friend into the Sanctuary with an arm, which she continues to wave about the Sanctuary. "I needed to recover a measure of peace and quiet. All of us, we almost died at Dzur Mountain. I almost lost everyone. I didn't even cast protections until the battle started." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Battle?" asks Sharra. "The lich?" She hesitates in the door frame, as if uninvited. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "No." Maja shakes her head. "Overconfidence and Major Death servants. Three or four, plus invisible undead. It wouldn't have been so bad, but I haven't had to fight alone in a long time. Without your firepower, I'm out of practice," She shrugs. "I turned a Major death away, perhaps two, but Wedge saved me from another two. He wouldn't let them take us. I think he's truly independent." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The women pause, lost in their own thoughts. After a time, Maja looks over at Sharra and exclaims, "You're hurt! Come accept the nurturing of Brilliance, you fool mage!" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Something is odd. No chance exists for ... 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra mistakes the height of the last stair and stumbles into the chamber. She makes a desolate moan as she drops her crutches, flailing about with her arms. The woman attempts to cushion her head with her arms, but the crutches hinder her motion, and her body begins to twist oddly, impossibly... 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Although there are no likelihood's within, you are able to change the Decameron's body angle as it leaves the stairwell. Sharra lands on her forearms and palms, not on her spine, not on her neck, nor head. The Decameron remains motionless on the Ground a moment, two, three... 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance exist for you to recognize that Sharra is cursed: no chance exists that she can enter this chamber safely. This is an Illithid Curse! A Probability Curse in a fixed circumstance to study... ! 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Are you well?" says Maja, still lying relaxed, completely ignorant of the slim distance that passed between Sharra and death. "Can I give you a hand?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Hoping for a foot," Sharra's reply is muffled from the dirt. "Ambushed, Swords of Sharpness. The battle wasn't over." Sharra remains prone until Maja stands and walks over to lift her from the ground. "They wanted the High One as much as the child." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Kayleigh?" Maja asks. Then, peering at you on the stair, she demands, "Where's Rune?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "He lost a foot with me, and a hand later on." Sharra rises, pulling on Maja's arm. The Decameron points to the crutches and balances on her good leg while Maja retrieves them. She is shaking, but it is not from weakness in her leg. Sharra regards you and you see her face is pale, so pale that you see streaks beneath her eyes. "Bird did not fall. She is ... formidable. Rune introduced me after." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Oh," says Maja, not interested. "Is Kayleigh ... well?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Unknown." says Sharra. "Gone. Bird said Kayleigh 'departed' moments before the attack, and refused to answer Rune's tantrum." Sharra smiles. "Madame Bird is a b-" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No chance exists for Sharra to finish her word. A chance exists that it was a critically important word. You will look for a chance to hear it later. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "So we don't know whether the child survived?" interrupts Maja. "With Kayleigh gone, what did he do?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra shakes her head, looking at the floor. "He ... 'follows the wishes of the High One' and 'may not visit for a time.'" Sharra pauses with uncharacteristic hesitancy. "Don't make me choose between a lie and a broken promise," she finishes. When Maja says nothing, Sharra and turns to face her. "He asked me to give you something." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja's face brightens, banishing her frown. Sharra spreads her arms wide and lets her crutches fall. Maja looks on without comprehension until Sharra leans forward to embrace her, to hug her tightly. The women remain this way for many moments. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "So he thinks he's not coming back from this one?" says Maja. Sharra remains silent. "Well, that man is often wrong." says Maja, continuing with startling clarity in the Sanctuary, as if making Prophesy, or swearing an Oath, "One day I will have all of his secrets." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja suddenly kneels next to Sharra's injured leg. "Let's fix what can be fixed today." She lifts her hands to test the edges of the wounded flesh, causing Sharra to wince and sway, but not to cry out. The shearjashub of Maja Barusse looks over at you then, and lifts her holy symbol for a miracle. You nod back to her with respect before turning away to climb the stairs.
