 The Terror dog has been eaten by Dira, or what's left. of Dira. There's this guy named Seth, who is Dira cloned by Walking Dude in the Womb of Cello (Sentient Lisa's iahklu Cello, onetime wielder of Death by Water.) 


 Seth had the powers of Dira, unawakened and silent. Dira had once drunk the blood of a Truthsay, and Seth had partial Rakshasha powers until Seth ate your dog and assumed full Dira Memories and Full Rakshasa powers. He wants to get off the Forbidden Island, and away from Jorie. Signs point to Seth having enough resentment and anger towards Jorie that Dira's bastard may just take out Luces Rojo's bastard if one doesn't leave the Forbidden Isle soon. It's not big enough for the both of them. 


 Look at it this way; imagine that Seth has drunk the Blood of  [roland](roland.md)  (4-armed "Water" Ape) as well as the Blood of di Griz (Fire Rat). Imagine the possibilities if Seth drank  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) 's Blood (Wind Wolf) to combine all four elemental mammals in one body. This may have already happened. This may be happening, This may be about to happen. Recall Dira was parent of the Kwisatz Haderach, the heir of "Everything." What if the Blood Powers are inheritable?
