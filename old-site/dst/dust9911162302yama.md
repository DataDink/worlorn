# dust in the wind

 yama dharma responds

Greetings to High Lord Kalkin the Binder, Loyal Son of Death 
>
>   My messenger delivering this missive is a dead elf lord, equipped with Elven Chain, a non-magical fine armor such as elf lords and ladies wear throughout  [asteroid](asteroid.md) . Notice the fine craftsmanship and the sublime mithril shine. 
>
>   While I'm certain you can now duplicate its fine links 7777 times using your Dominance of your  [goldcard](goldcard.md) , I suggest that if you are planning to equip your army with "elven" chain, consider making a deal with one of the "elven" Smith Gods: Llewellyn ap-Owen's latest NPC incarnation " [threnody](threnody.md) , Greater Princess of Evil Drow Devils" or his PC Nightmare, " [blacksword](blacksword.md)  the Phoenix." 
>
>   You may have heard that while I CAN make elven chain, I do not. You may have heard that while Champion  [damon](damon.md)  CAN make Drow items and forge black Mithril, he does not. You may have heard that while  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md)  CAN make Dwarven Axes, he does not. It is not wise to assume a foreign racial archetype, especially one controlled by another deity. However, if you are planning to go to war against an elven archetype faction, of course you would not wish to make the elven deities aware. 
>
>   Regardless, I would be delighted to aid you in your endeavors, You have been asleep so long. It was boring out here. 

-Yama Dharma, Deathgod
