# dust in the wind

 regard my words

```

Please regard my words this morning.  I have learned Chysofar, that if you are
winning, why do anything?  Were things so desparate as you thought you had
to act?  The cycle is not over, and I'm sticking to that statement.  Please
reverse your action ... the best way to affect what you want to happen is to
do it in such a way as for no one to even realize what you have done. Stop
thinking so grandly.  Forgiveness for everything is possible, but you must
take the first step.
