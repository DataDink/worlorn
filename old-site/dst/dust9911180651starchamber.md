# dust in the wind



 omnis goodknight speaks for shal omnis

*As of now, WIND carries that Dust A Rose Power. Let's see who can counter THAT one. Grrrrrrrrrrr. So anyone who breathes.....hee hee hee....is turned to Dust* 
 Greetings to all turfs who hear my voice. I am Omnis GoodKnight, emissary of her holiness Shal Omnis. We offer the good will, light and love for Shal Omnis upon you all. 



* We ask Chrysofar to immediately revoke her use of the Wind to carry her DUST. We implore you to find other benevolent ways to accomplish your goals my lady. Do not stoop to the methods of those you oppose. Rise above and over come. It may yet, not be to late.
* We believe that DUST and all associated with DUST have forged new enemies, including the noble guardians of those who sleep. We suggest an immediate apology and reparations to be paid to all who have been affected by this action.
* We, the followers of Shal Omnis, request from Chyrsofar, to allow Shal Omnis to offer her followers her Sanctuary and love, that Chrysofar allow the immediate construction of a temple to Shal Omnis within her borders. We further request that our missionaries and emissaries be along to freely travel within your lands. In return, the Sanctuary of Shal Omnis will be available to you and your followers wherever our temples are found. We realize you serve another and record shows that we have forged many cooperative pacts with him who you serve. We ask only for the opportunity to coexist with your temples to work together for a greater good. We await your reply.
* To all who hear my voice ... listen. Shal Omnis is great and she is merciful. If you will allow us to establish a temple within your borders, you and your people will also have access to a place of Sanctuary within those borders. For all who will allow our light, we will return our love. If you will allow our temple, without demands, please respond to all who hear with a whole hearted "YES". We await your reply friends.
* To any who are lost, you are now found. Our clerics within Troad and other lands await your arrival to one of our temples. We look forward to sharing with you the light and the rewards of Shal Omnis (see literature for more details). Followers are always welcome so search your heart. Nielsen ratings have shown that we are the fastest growing church with Worlorn today. Call our clerics to find out how you too can become a part of this new path to righteousness and fulfillment.
* Let it be known, that we are offering a reward of immense wealth to any individual or group that frees Faella from her bonds within Hissarlik. We ask the dominator of Hissarlik to consider the release of our paladin, within the rules of your land.
* We, the followers of Shal Omnis thank each of you for the opportunity to send our emmissaries to you to deliver this message. May order be restored to yours lands.
