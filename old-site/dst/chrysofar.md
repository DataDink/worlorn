 Subject: Oh yeah? A Reply to Eressea** 
 As she listens to your speech, Chrysofar's eyes go flat black, the color of thunder, of darkness.....the color of worlds and life and love and hope lost in an empty heart. When she speaks it is quiet, so only you hear, and there is an undercurrent of bitterness, pain, loss, and an intangible something that makes you remember with clarity that she had been shadow-morganti'd at one time. 

 "Bringing Morgan back your greatest achievement? I don't think so. I think it was to absolve your guilt. 

 And as for the woman in the grave, well, you -could- have saved her. And all others like her, no more wu hsin forevermore. But you refused a direct order from your liege, the lord you were sworn to, and now, now there is still real death and Wasteland and all the things that come after. 

 You have no honor, Erresea. And you are responsible for every single Morganti death that happened or will happen after the day you refused that direct order from Troy. Someday I will have to relive that shadow-Morganit so that you may participate, and experience for yourself what you are now responsible for, becasue you could have destroyed it all and you didn't. 

 Life. Love. What the hell do you know about any of it, Eressea the Betrayer, Maker of Wastelands? There are some fates even worse than the Real Death. 

 All those lofty goals. All these lofty speeches, and still, where, where were you when the world went to hell and you could have beent here to stop it? 

 Life. Would that you had given -my- life back so I could have at least tried. Life. Love. Bah!" 

 She turns from you with a shortness, a motion you recognize as power held in check, but barely. She doesn't seem to see anyone else as she makes her way out, away, with the gait of a figure of stone brought to motion by the force of will alone.
