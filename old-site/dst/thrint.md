>is there general [Thrint] knowledge?
any good githzerai would recall that the ancient slaveraces include the
Thrints, Hee Chee, Shai Halud, Sleeth, and Beholders, as well as the mind
flayers that were masters of the Githzerai and Githyanki races. slavers
were the beings who Dominated all of Worlorn until the Troy Ounces
personality arrived and staked out his turf to Dominate. slavers were
never able to become inspired by the Muses, so they enslaved the folks
who could be Inspired and fed off their Inspiration.
physical dominators as well as mental, Thrints are more beefy and muscular
than mind flayers, and do not share the physical appetites of the gith races'
dominators. Thrint tore Inspiration from the minds of their slaves, but never
consumed the brains as Mind Flayers do.
Thrints had poor coordination and worse imagination. in addition to Dominating
races for Inspiration, they enslaved imaginative artificer races, such as the
moties, Jaenshi, Mitheranean, and Atheleni to make tools for enhancing Thrint
domination over the physical world. 
no chance exists to meet a random Thrint. the Thrint are known to Githyanki
and Githzerai, as well as the Mitheraneans, Atheleni, and the few remaining
Jaenshi.
to this day a chance exists to meet Sleeth within the Ether and on the Astral
Planes. Sleeth never dominated slaves themselves, but rather appeared at odd
intervals in raids to feed on the slaves of other slaveraces. 
>What does one do to a Thrint?
show him the soles of your shoes as you run away.
the Thrint is a mithril rank creature like all slaveraces. mithril rank
creatures can ignore Domination from non-mithril rank creatures, however,
a chance exists for a weaker creature to Invoke the Dominance of at least
a +4 physical weapon and/or 8th level spell.

alone, Morin would be pretty much in the category of screwed. to modify
the Thrint Attack die roll, Morin would have to find a Knock artifact or
become mithril rank or better. 
Thrint enslavement attack = flat save with no modifiers: roll a 13 or higher
on a d20 or your mind is enslaved. no known psionics or mental device/discipline
can modify the save or make one immune to the Thrint.
because gith have NATURAL racial ability of probability travel, a mithril
Morin would be able to use his dice in defense to travel to a plane in
which the Thrint did not dominate Morin. NOTE WELL: a mithril rank Morin
would be unable to defend a non-mithril rank companion with Morin's
probability travel.
within Worlorn, a flat 13 save is usually a Knock effect. Knock was one of
the Dominator personalities arriving in the first Cycle of Inspiration,
under the Muse of Comedy. if the Thrints were Dominated by Knock, then a
chance exists that a Knock artifact could Dominate a Thrint. Knock artifacts
fall in two categories: gold cards and dragonbones.
