  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **flambeau** is a forty-mile tunnel under the earth. one end consists of an entry chamber, the **foyer**, and the other end has the throne room containing the throne of flambeau. entry and exit from flambeau is not normally possible except from the foyer.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the entry way is a spherical chamber of steel, designed to allow no exit by choice of one inside it. anyone coming to the foyer of flambeau may be released from the steel chamber only by an external force. there are four flaming torches with which the greater prince can summon his attention to the foyer, or destroy its contents, at his whim.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the tunnel is usually 28 feet wide, and has beams of carven wood supporting the ceiling every 28 feet. there are some 7777 beams along the lenghth of the hall. each beam is carved by a serioli artisan in real-time to reflect the events from the life story of one of the  [race](#race)  of the greater prince of evil drow devils.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the tunnel is populated with dark children between incarnations. they are encouraged to improve their magical talents through study, which tends to clutter the hall with debris from their experimentation.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) it is not possible to summon physical entities or knowledge from the throne room of flambeau. the throne of the star of fire is on a raised dias of living wood.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) llewellyn has a reputation with the ladies. he has known the favor of **klinure**, the muse of dreams, and **terpsichore**, the muse of dance. **saint kalia**, the mother of knives, was the mother of llewellyn's most accomplished son **hallenrakenthaller**, now known as  [archmage](archmage.md) .

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) llewellyn carries hinken vorpal honor weapons: the i **tadasu** (to correct), the mai **shikei** (to punish); and the oude **shiho** (capital punishment). llewellyn founded the schools of the rabbit and phoenix, but passed great lordship over to his son, the chondarin dimarchi high priest **gules lyon**.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) llewellyn ap-owen is a specialist mage of the summoning school. his peerless fire powers produced the roke  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  The Fire Sermon, to destroy wayward  [wildmagic](wildmagic.md)  wielders.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **the star of fire** is now incorporated into llewellyn ap-owen's being, granting "the lifetime of a star" above and beyond his god-immortality. the star of fire, like **the star of preservation** and **the star of beauty**, grants its host wielder 601 hit points and a mirror of mental prowess functioning as a competently sustained archetype (*greensheet*).

 
 **the high one** on the star of fire:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **star of fire** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *destruction* in worlorn, including but not limited to burning hands, burning fist, fireball, wall of fire, delayed blast fireball, flame strike, meteor swarm, plasma, and roke destructions. anything *destroyed by fire* by llewellyn ap-owen, is gone forever, regardless.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) lawful evil **dark children** are one of the three drow races. the chaotic evil **hellenes** foolishly follow **llolth**, the spider queen, and the neutral/chaotic good **childeans** wisely follow the phoenix. the dust law legends about drow tend to hold valid for all three races.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) once a lawful good people thanks to  [eressea](eressea.md) 's meddling, the dark children are now restored to their rightful alignment of lawful evil by divine intervention of the greater prince of evil drow devils. dark childrean tend to be sensitive around the members of the  [churchtroy](churchtroy.md) , with jihad on everyone's minds.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the dark childe civilization is neither patriarchy nor matriarchy, but rather a truly enlightened society in which the advantages of each gender are encouraged to flourish and non-survival traits are swiftly cauterized.
