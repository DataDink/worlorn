# dust in the wind

 observations are not limited to just Besgar

 (although his were brilliant)

```

As I understand things, Chrysofar isn't really DUST but more like an AVATAR
of DUST.  What would a god do if their avatar really really screwed up --
even turned to the other side?  Hmmmmm.  Get another avatar?
Just a thought.
Now I know what some of you are thinking, DUST must be very happy with
Chrysofar ... initially, perhaps he was.  But now, with all worlds turning
against her, with her ability to do anything anymore severely limited or
terminated, you think he is still happy? Maybe dust outta find someone else
... any voluteers?
