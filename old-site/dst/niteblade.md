#### niteblade's arrival in worlorn

 "I summon thee, Niteblade," cried Llew...The Apparition was male, elven featured , with the white skin of a dark childe. He bore a plain metal circlet on this brow as a crown, and wore the galvorn metal chain mail of a dark childe nobleman, similar to the armor worn by Llew under his cloaks. The apparition fingered a brooch holding its cloak shut. "I bind and command thee: speak to me thrice truly! Art thou Nightblade, known as Knight Founder of the Free Ranger Hall? said Llew. 
 "I am," said the apparition. The figure extended its arm, and probed forward with its sword, a foot above the grooves Llew had traced ... Blue sparks flared from the tip of the sword to the hilt, tracing a spider web's pattern along the blade. The apparition withdrew his weapon from the rune, although both appeared unharmed. 


 "Art thou willing servant and Archangel of Shal Omnis?" said Llew. 


 "I am," said the apparition. It raised its empty hand to adjust the plain diadem on its head, and frowned. It moved its shoulders in small circles: Vlad recognized them as lossening exercises he used before swordplay. 


 "Wilt thou enter to a land that knows not the nurturing had of Shal Omnis, and once here, assist those creatures good and just, we creatures of the light, that we might bring renewed life back to a dying land?" 


 "I will," said the apparition, sheathing its sword. 


 "Know then, I am Llewellyn ap-Owen, and although I am known as Greater Prince of the Evil Drow Devils, I summoned thee for this purpose. Know that once summoned and released in this place, you shall have freedom to act as you will, for I vow never to use the summoning name against you ...I free you of all bindings to your past!" 


 Llew knelt swiftly, even as he spoke the last word, and extended his left index finger into the groove of the rune. All candles went out, including the stub Llew still held. The figure Nightblade reeled a moment as if stuck, moaning. He fell to one knee, hand going to his now naked brow. 


 "Welcome to the Wastelands of Worlorn," said Vlad, approaching the two ....

 Roland: I'm glad you stopped to talk to me. I have been setting here watching everyone come and go and damnit, only other person stops to talk to me. Everyone has their own agenda ... noone sees the big picture. Do you see the big picture yet? 
 Here is what I propose: you have goals, I have goals, we all have goals. Lets work together to achieve them. You help me, I'll help you. What do you say? 


 Here are the goals I would like to achive: 


 1) TURF: I am the turf wielder errant to a certain section of property. I want to claim it and I need the crown of good might to do it. 


 2) WORLORN: What is the status of this world and what is going on and who the hell is walking around with a morgani weapon ... my soul is crying out in pain!!! He must stop or be stopped. 


 3) UNITY: Identify the other turf errants and form a union to fix this mess once and for all. 


 Are you with me Roland? Chrysofar, if you are still here, are you with me/us? E. will you help? Will you allow us access to Dolbadarn 


 I want to help you also. Cooperation is the game. Sharing infomation and pooling our resources. Lets work together, not apart. There is much I can do to help all of you ... are we are team?

 as identified, I have goals. TURF, UNITY, and WORLORN. I also have Salt Peters Places of power which tell me about The System, Worlord Gold Card Turf and potential turf, along with thrones and focus items. Wasteland, Land Law, and alot of notes. I may be one of a very few PCs with the info and the key to the restoration of turf. I will accomplish this ... hopefully with help.

 The name you use in vain is my Diety, I am her Arch-Angel. This might be compared to you being the "Defender of Troy" to some degree. As for interfering with Troy ... if you believe there can be only one diety in the world, they yes. If you believe two or more deities can co-exist in the world then ... no. Shal-Omnis is the god/goddess of Dragons and extends a lot of power in my world. She is coming here, even as I have foretold, for I am the wind on which the message travels. I am willing to assist you in the restoration of Troy for the good of the world. I am, however, not a follower of Troy ... for my only alliegance can be to my diety. Judge me by my actions: 





 
#### Excerpt from Adventures Beyond DrowLand #3: "In Search of Troy"

 I travelled north to the FROST so bold, Where dragons ruled and the world was cold. A cage imprisioned the one called TROY, Killing the dragons, I freed the TOY.

 Erresea ... As you know, I have been looking for turf for some time. I had turf before entering this world. It was known as South Mestea Isle and it contained a large populous of dragons ... a majority of them were green dragons but there were reds, golds, and the like. Llue. thought the South Pole was a possible sight for that turf in this world. Threnody seems to agree. However, Roland calls the South Pole his home. Question. Is the South Pole, in your opinion, the best choice for turf or is there another island near the pole which meets this criteria. Would it be better to get the focus then let the focus "pull" me towards my turf? thanks for any assistance ... N.
