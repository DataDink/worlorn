# high one's pattern



a universal design

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  [highone](highone.md)  chose to follow tanngrisnir's wisdom and establish a larger-than-original pattern, imposing a 21-veil pattern as the prevalent design throughout  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  in the chaos after patternfall.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the twenty-veil  [pattern](pattern.md)  was known to  [oberon](oberon.md) , so when  [tanngrisnir](tanngrisnir.md)  recreated new lands of troy for his own pleasure, he expanded the original pattern to 28 veils. tanngrisnir's goal was to make  [troad](troad.md)  encompass a number of veils beyond oberon's influence. evidence suggests that these eight 'extra' veils are what sustained new troad through patternfall and the end of the  [dreams](dreams.md) . 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) strong evidence exists suggesting that the design of both oberon's and tanngrisnir's patterns have much in common with kolwynia, gateway, and the senethar, in such a way that mastery of one key allows command of the others.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) successfully imposing a pattern that upholds inspiration of multiple  [muses](muses.md)  alleviates much of the high one's worry about  [dance](dance.md)  exterminating all previous inspiration.
