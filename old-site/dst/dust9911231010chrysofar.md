# dust in the wind



 naming names

```
		
Modifications to Dust in the Wind effective as of [99.11.23 10:10]

Naming my Name doesn;t do anything but get my attention. It doesn;t
automatically turn you into Dust unless I decide I really hate your guts
at the moment.
The Dust in the Wind effect is modified to be carried ONLY on Night
Winds, wich of course only show up at night....this is supposed to give
the starlight effect and allow people to adventure during the day/out of
Red light.
