# worlorn asteroid

where are we, anyway?

A quiet man's voice, in Thari, coming from far away in the wind: 
 "When I came to the asteroid Worlorn, it was all Wasteland. I found the  [muses](muses.md)  and studied them for a while. I then cleared away some unruly folks and staked out some  [turf](turf.md)  for people to have sweet dreams. Soon after, others staked out some Turf for their own Reign, but no one else on Worlorn could grant experience points for adventures without the statue of the Muse of  [dreams](dreams.md) , Klinure. This is why Troad fell with the Statue of the Muse stolen.

### Threnody on Worlorn

 "*. . . of all the creatures on Worlorn, only  [troy](troy.md)  (The Human One, AKA  [dworkin](dworkin.md) ) was able to gain his Turf without having a place of ultimate power _before_ he claimed it.* 
#### The HISTORY
>
>   Worlorn is an asteroid which is not goverened by natural laws other than those imposed by sentient thought. When no single being has absolute control of laws for a given area, then that area is called Wasteland. Wasteland is governed by the expectations of the generic mind, sometimes referred to as "the Most Common Dominator." 
>
>   When Troy Ounces discovered Worlorn, it had been charted but not visited by a Bonze (warrior of the empty hand) name of Celia Marcyan. Celia spoke of the asteroid while in a monastary Troy was visiting. The description of a world of no boundaries amused Troy to no end. Of course he had to visit. 
>
>   Upon his arrival Troy found many races of strongly disciplined minds vying for power; races which we know somewhat of to this day: Hrun, Hee-chee, Mithreraneans (the source of mithril), Athelini (source of “black mithril”), Thrint, Dactlyoids, Monoceros (unicorns), and the many races of dragons. 
>
>   While ALL the races on Worlorn are known to be non-natives, the origins of many are shrouded in mystery. Generally there were two classes of beings in the Wasteland: psionic dreamers and foodslaves. An example of this relationship that continues to our day is the mind flayers dominating githyanki and githzerai.
>
>   Troy saw the situation on Worlorn and deemed it more challenging than he expected. So he drew up a plan. First he had to stake a landclaim against the other Slavers and then he had to enforce it. He hid his intent and power from the slavers and studied among the slaves for many months, perhaps over a year. That year must have been as dangerous as it was enlightening to Troy.
>
>   . . . With the  [oimota](oimota.md) , we can command the heart to grant us land area and bind our muse to it without falling under the control of the heart. The heart is the demon amulet of the Motherlode, who is generally of a lawful good disposition and would not willingly give up any powers to a creature who has ever killed any creature intentionally. There is no f*cking way Erin of Dolkris will qualify under the Heart's rules.
