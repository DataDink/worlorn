Threnody to Chrysofar:
After a fashion I am Silverfox's grandfather, but I don't have any memory 
of it. My life started on the shoreline of Dolbadarn, with Vlad Tollenkov's
concerned face hovering over me. He asked me what I remembered, and I told
him not much. He lifted me from the beach and told me I had a lot of learning
to do.
We went to the village I knew as my home town, but there wasn't anyone there 
who knew me, despite me knowing all of them as if I grew up there. I can 
still tell you how the old men say when the hunt's begun, and what the 
girls there do when they decide they're going to make a man into a husband. 
The buildings all looked like they did when I grew up there, the people were 
just a few years older than I remembered, and my house was there with my 
mother and father and sisters...but none of them knew my face, or could tell 
me my name. I had Vlad take us away before night fell, and we've never been 
back. I live at Dolbadarn with Tollenkov and his wife, the lady Eressea, if 
I ever feel the need to stay in one place.
Once Tollenkov took me to the Fountains of Paradise, and showed me how the 
folks there would treat me as the Phoenix, god of rebirth, god of elves, 
but it was more than I could cope with, so we fled almost immediately. Not 
too much fun having people worship you for things you never did, and having 
expectations about you that you can never fulfill. I go back, but only when
Tollenkov and I need elven healing beyond what we can get from his Eressene 
friends.
I guess this kind of lost personal history is what drove the Half-elven One 
out of Troad. I'm probably lucky Llewellyn never had turf to host iahklu, 
with all of them turning to him for every kind of help. I have enough trouble 
coping with my own past let alone being responsible for everyone's. I read
and sing about all the things Llewellyn did, and I try and I try but I can't
remember any of it. maybe it's just as well. I'd probably go mad if I had
the kind of life and unfulfilled responsibilities that Llewellyn ap-Owen did.

Dear Threnodi:
Most Respected Bard,
I am a person who knew you before you were deprived of your stature and
memory. While you and I did not always agree, we usually worked toward the
same ends. 
I will tell you that once you controlled vast power, and that I once
travelled with you and called you friend. We both were members of The Circle
of Light, though I took up a morganti weapon and offended you greatly in
doing so. I revered you and your dedication to the preservation of life, and
in my folly once developed a spell which appealed to you directly for power.
 I appealed once to often to you and in so doing gained your scorn, I would
say I appealed to you becuase I believed we were friends and that you and I
wanted the same things, but I did still do this and I am sorry. Had I but
known that it inconvenienced you, I would not have appealed to you at all.
I know that you can recall nothing of this and in many ways this will
represent another thing or even person to you. To me, though, it is a debt,
which though you may not feel it is owed, I feel duty bound to discharge.
 This duty is both one of honor to an honorable man, and one of compassion to
one who was once a friend. If you have a need, merely let me know, and I
will work to effect its end. Should you need funds, or materiels, I can try
to assist. You and Eressea, have an open invitation to Elfhome, and I offer
you sanctuary at my residence, for as long as you might care to stay. 
It is important to me that you understand that this offer carries no hidden
meanings, no ties or debt is implied. I would like for us to be friends
again, as we once were. You were once compassionate to me and you would be
doing me a great honor if you allowed to repay some same kindness.
In fondest memory
Erin The Fan, Ko Mori No Te
