 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The holdfast bladesmen were recognized in the the third decade of the Necrodemian Empire. Until that time the kav elfar were harassed and persecuted whenever they displayed their holdfast longswords in a Necrodemian city. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  If kav elfar bladesman training had been any less vigorous, the art may have become extinct.
