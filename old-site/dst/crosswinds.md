>   **Crosswinds** is above ground, wherever air is. If a an entity could jump really really high, he might be able to launch himself into Crosswinds from the ground at some point. There is a Stairway to Heaven (spiral staircase made of moving points of air that move so fast they glow, looking rather like those spots behind your eyes if you close your eyes and press on them) at some Undetermined Location within the Wastelands. It moves around randomly or at  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) 's Will, so it is going to be hard to find...on purpose.
>
>   **Geography**: It's a land of ice and dark, much like Alaska in the winter. Chrysofar deals with alt.heart of light or  [candle](candle.md)  to get what little light exists, and  [redlight](redlight.md)  gets Transformed the very inifinite moment it manifests, falling as boringly normal starlight with no ill effects. There are hockey rinks and dog mushing trails all over the place. People live happily in log homes or redone Victorians. Chrysofar's home base is a huge crystalline castle that glows a faint shade of blue (like her sword). People get around by skiing, sledding, snowboarding, and most especially skating. There are polished ice trails for skaters along with teh dog trails.
>
>  Temnperature is localized. REALLY localized. People pick what temp they want around themselves and that is what they get. Snowboarders in brightly colored jams and Gargoyles shriek downhill next to dog mushers in full arctic gear, fur ruffs and all. Some folks run about in swimsuits, wearing VR glasses to simulate beaches, sipping tropical drinks. Weather: Snows every night to replenish the trails. Ice is hit with the everpresent Zambonis at "daybreak". 
>
>  You can tell time if you know the  [constellations](constellations.md)  (Orion; the Dog Team; the Hockey Player; Elindanar; one Chrys called "Troy's Sorrow"; the Hourglass; and the Three Wolves, to name a few--yes,  [almitra](almitra.md) 's got Transformed a bit as they entered my sky as well. Heck, i expect her to chaosize my Air, what the hell.) Moons: there is one, and it is huge. At full, you can read without a lamp. Those with night vision need Gargoyles. Most folk here have infravision anyhow so they don't *need* light.

#### Points of interest
>
>   **The Fighter School of the Wind Wolf** sits in the center of the town. Ice sculptures abound around it; some are calligraphy cahracters. Seems the school goes for the total warrior: these folk are trained to be poets, artists, and vicious empty hand fighters, as well as specialists with varying swords and bows. The students run around clad in black tunics embroidered with a silver wolf with blue arcing around its head. They are generally barefoot, as that is the most effective way to kick a weapon out of someone's hands.
>
>  **Chrysofar's Castle** (as yet unnamed) is a huge crystalline, glowing structure on a hill at the edge of town. it boasts a hockey rink, stables, loads of guest rooms, and a really good chef, as well as junk food vending machines, two computer labs (Next and Mac) and a Dec alpha mainframe to do programming on. There is a lab for the castle's wizard, and a dog lot for Chrys' dog team and visiting wolfish relatives who prefer it out of doors. Fireplaces abound as well, but the flames in this place are blue, and give no warmth. The main stairwell is lined with portraits of family, life sized  [trump](trump.md)  done up as tarot cards. (Almitra and Simon are noticeably missing.)
>
>  **The Pizza Pub and Pool Joint** is in the middle of downtown and boasts a full screen of MTV and dance floor, juxtaposed with a full screen of NHL action and pool tables. the food here is great and the microbrew bar exceptional. Chrysofar wishes cousin  [klew](klew.md)  would visit and start a ruckus sometime. Local bands and bards play on weekends. There is an outdoor pool that never freezes, several hot tubs, and a sauna on the roof.

>  **Chrysofar** is a 5'10" half-melnibonean elfar with silvery white hair flowing down to her knees, and eyes the color of the sky at twilight (that three shades of blue). Her ears are pierced, top and bottom; the top piercings have iridescent hoops in them, the bottom ones have various gems, depending on what her mood is at the time (currenlty peridot and moonstone). There is a barely discernible white rose in her hair. Her canine teeth ar more pointed than most elven folk, and her face holds a trace of "other" that you can;t quite put a name to. She is beautiful--vengenace always is.
>
>  She wears a simple dark blue peasant shirt under her black armor, which covers one arm. the elbow is silver plate. Very faded Levis 501's frm the outlet store in Crosswinds are beneath the high black boots with silver tracings. If she feels the need, studded leather goes over the shirt and hangs down, tunic length, to her knees, split for horseback riding. She holds a blade nearly as tall as she is. The hilt is wrapped in blackj leather and the pommel is a dark blue stone. The blade itself shines bright silver, inscribed with a twisting pattern of two different kinds of chains that shows balck, as if inlaid. She holds it as if it were a part of her, in a hold so casual you can't imagine her without a sword.
>
>  In her eyes (one partially covered by a tray lock of hair) is the look of one who has lost so much she doesn't quite know how not to mourn anymore, balanced with a grim determination and a glint of steel.
>
>  Chrysofar is the Last Defender of Troy. When everyone else had turned their backs on the ruined, fallen  [troad](troad.md) , she, who could not be there to stop the fall, decided that revenge was best served by putting it all back. She came very close.

>
>  Chrysofar's aspect is Transformation.
>
>  Implementing this seems to be a matter of will and word. Don't like something? Fine. it's something else. Attacked by a swarm of gnats? They're flowers. the world is a much nicer, more customized place when your aspect is Transformation.
>
>  Legend has it this Transformation aspect showed up before the Wind powers did. Chrysofar did her best to Transform Wasteland back into a  [troad](troad.md)  recreated from faulty memory. She didn't do a bad job putting  [tanngrisnir](tanngrisnir.md)  back either--he isn't even a simulacrum anymore. The full depth of this Aspect has yet to be explored, but it seems to be able to affect time (as in, the ten days of travel we just did are now ten seconds). Immortality may be reachable through this--what fun!
>
>  Supposedly one of the least of the Turfs, Crosswinds with its Wind elements of Transformation could prove to be much more than anticipated. Don't like your enemies? Make them adorable puppies instead. It could get dangerous, of course., Get really mad at your lover and *poof* . . . so it's a good thing Chrysofar respects the free will of her fellow adventurers, riiight?

>  **Wind Chimes** These things are crystalline and the sounds that issue from them are the songs of stars and shadows. they make an unearthly, eerie sound. They are normally the size of normal wind chimes and can be carried by the focus wielder. Their song is an irresisitibel Charm, and the listener, if not of Melnibonean descent, is greatly desirous of doing as the wielder asks.
>
>  The sound of the chimes is enough to allow the wielder or Chrysofar even if the chimes are not present to Transform whatever into whatever at will. (Chrys wears a small replica of them around her neck.) Normal spells are not affected unless the caster invokes Chrys' name and asks for a specific desired effect. Then we'll see.
>
>   The WInd Chimes TRANSFORM anything else. They transform  [redlight](redlight.md)  into harmless starlight. they transform air into frantically waving, liht giving molecules. They transform a being into the most basic distillation of itself if Chrysofar so desires. They transform chaos into order, silence into song, Blood agents into piles of Dust, slayers of Kin of Troy into stone statues, wine into diet pepsi, and a whole host of other things.
>
>  They transform any and all attacks on Chrysofar. They detect, via wind motions, anyone entering the turf, and anyone saying Chrysofar's name.

 **the high one** on Wind Chimes:
>
>  the **Wind Chimes** provide, support, and control nine-tenths of all manifestations of *transformation* in worlorn.

>  **Melnibonean Elfar**: white haired elves, of course. Ferocious warriors, wonderful poets, and sometimes even decen calligraphers. All have infravision. Tyhey see in the dark better than in light. Most can shift to wolf form and take off in the Wind when necessary.
>
>  Melniboneans tend to be highly psionic, don't talk much but lep like crazy, inordinately fond of dark beer and heavy metal music, and are really good with bo kata, even with hockey sticks. Everyone can skate and mush, and recite the Bob and Doug Mackenzie version of the Twelve Days of Christmas from memory. Some have been known to end every sentence with "eh".
