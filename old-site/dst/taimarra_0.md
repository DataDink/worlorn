# taimarra’s first gift



sharing dreams

You're almost asleep, but mother shakes you awake. "Taimarra! It's not time for bed. You need to stay awake for now." 


 You open your eyes. Nothing much has changed. It's still cold. Your left mitten is still in mother's hand, and her hands are both a pretty blue you've never seen before. Her right hand isn't strong enough to grap yours any more, so Mother pulls you along with both hands now, through the snow, up the mountain. Father is up ahead, leading, and carrying Baby Sam in his arms. His steps are shorter than before. Mother and you are keeping up with him with hardly any extra effort. baby Sam is probably not so cold. Sam gets the blanket, because she's the Baby now, and you are not. 


 There's snow everywhere you look. It's on the trees, on the ground, even the sky is the color of snow. Last year's winter was the first one you remember, but you don't think it was this white. At least it's daytime. Last night it was even harder to stay awake. You never walked all night before. No one you know ever walked all night. 


 You close your eyes for a moment after mother looks away, but instantly she's shaking your arm again, harder than before, and she has the scary tone in her voice. You aren't walking, and you think you may have been standing still for a while, maybe without walking for a while. It's Red Light, and you know what that means. Soon it will be night time and you will have even more trouble staying awake. 


 "Tam! Look honey, it's really important that you don't sleep now. Can you hear me dear? Honey, Tam, look, dear it's time for you to carry Samantha now. Father is too tired. He has to rest for a while." 


 Father is lying down on his stomach. Father usually sleeps on his back, and snores. Father is not snoring now. Sam is still in her blanket, the only one left, the only one Father could find. Sam's the Baby, so she gets the Blanket. Sam is in Mother;s lap now. You never get to sit there any more, not since Sam got to be the Baby. 


 "Tam, Honey, I'm going to stay with Father now." Mother's lips are black in Red Light, the same color as her fingers. You didn't see her take any make-up from the house. "Do you see that fire up the mountain?" Mother points with her whole arm. Her fingers are all curled together on the end, the way they are when she holds your hand. You look up, and since it's not snowing very hard, you can see the fire. The flames are almost the same color as Red Light, which makes them harder to see. 


 "I see them Mother." 


 Mother puts her hands on each side of your face, and turns your head to face her. They are cold as the snow, not warm like Mother's hands are supposed to be. they are also stiff, and crusted with ice like your clothes are. 


 "I want you to take Sam to the fire. This is very important dear. You need to take Sam to the fire, before you can sleep. When you get to the fire, if it's in a cabin or house or cave, you need to wait until after Red Light before you knock on the door. No one will let you in if you knock on the door during Red Light--" 


 "I know _that_ Mother! I'm not the Baby any more." She looks at you and then smiles, but she's crying. 


 "Tam, you need to take Sam to the fire and let the people there know where Father and I are sleeping. You can go to sleep after you take Sam to the fire and tell them Mother and Father are sleeping here. Do you understand?" 


 "Yes, Mother." 


 Mother tries to pick up Sam, but her fingers aren't working right, so you have to puck her up in your mittens. Mother manages to unwrap the blanket a bit and put it over your head, like a shawl. "Tell them where we are." She says, and pushes you up the mountain. 


 You begin to walk alone, and turn around after two steps. Mother is lying down next to Father, arranging her cloak. You look hard at the fire and begin to walk. It's a long walk, but you think you can get there before you have to sleep. 


 After ten steps, you wake up, and later you wake up later. Sam is asleep, but she's the Baby, and you have an Order from Mother. No sleeping until you reach the fire. It's still Red Light, and you can see the flames closer but still up the mountain. They look like they're coming from a square window in a house, but you can't tell for certain. When you turn around you can see your tracks, but Mother and Father are hidden behind the trees. You walk some more, but wake up with your face in a snowdrift, on the ground with Sam crying. You must have fallen asleep and then fallen on her! You hold Samantha tightly, cooing at her, and she calms, crying but not hysterical. You look at the fire, and wish they would hear Samantha's cries. You lay there for a few more minutes, and Sam stops crying. You lay down only for another second. You close your eyes, because you know you'll open them again in a second. 


 They are beating you awake. All five ogres are clubbing you, bringing their maces down on your head, legs, and chest. You draw your Slaver Weapon, lift your arm, and one hits your wrist, shattering bone and flinging the Weapon across the camp. 


 "No more Dreams! No more Dreams!" they chant in unison. It becomes the ogre mantra, like an oarsman's song to beat time. They hit you each time they chant. "No more Dreams" *thud* "No more Dreams" *smack* 


 You begin to crawl away, and they let you, cointinuing to pummel you as you move. You find your bow, and use it in your good hand as a crutch. When you get to your feet, you run, leaving everything behind.
