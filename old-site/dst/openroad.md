# open road



the legends of the wyrld wyrm

once upon a time,  [traveller](traveller.md)  high-ironjade x became master of the road. this was an asphalt road in the  [troad](troad.md) , the lands of  [troy](troy.md) . under the natural and supernatural laws of the troad, waldann had achieved the power to control the natural and supernatural laws of the asphalt road. 
 eventually waldann came to discover that a path of the asphalt road led to a road made of gold scales, a road which was not at all within the troad. this  [goldroad](goldroad.md)  led to other  [domains](domains.md)  which held peerage to troad, other domains with their own masters like troy ounces. the gold road was not like the dominions of the seven worlds, but it was not an eighth world either. the gold road was as a many-taloned golden dragon, stretched in the void that separates the worlds, a dragon with worlorn's seven worlds in its grasp. 


 waldan discovered (like many before him) that walking on the back of the gold dragon road allowed travellers to cross between worlorn's seven domains without suffering from the void. waldann travelled between the seven worlds until he knew them all. 


 waldan then discovered and achieved mastery of an eighth domain which was somewhat akin to the road, but was more like one of the worlds in the grasp of the dragon. however, waldann did not come to dominate a world clutched in the grasp of the dragon. waldann dominated a world which he kept freely travelling on the back of the dragon, as if it was a traveller itself. using his hard-earned map of the dragon's back, waldann high-ironjade x could keep his world from falling into an empty talon of the dragon. waldann called this roaming world “the glove box,” and he called the chariot for moving along the dragon road's back "the magic bus." 


 although no longer subject to the laws of the troad, waldann frequently stopped in the lands of troy. waldann found himself a wife in troad and established temples to worship waldann as the god of the open road. for some time, the magic bus travelled freely and waldann came to be a common legend of the seven worlds. rumors from the  [northpole](northpole.md)  indicate that waldann high-ironjade x may have travelled further than the seven worlds and be known elsewhere, outside of worlorn. 


 some time later, waldann's travels were interrupted by a magic spell. this spell came from all seven worlds of worlorn, and it revoked waldann's life force within these worlds. waldann did not wish to part with his life force, so he stopped travelling aong the seven worlds to think about matters. 


 before he came to any decision, the void around the dragon road became filled with chaos. every time and place waldann looked at the road side, waldann could see only flux and chaos where there once was void. the golden dragon road was swimming in a sea of chaos! with the immersion of the dragon road in chaos, waldann discovered that the magic spell from worlorn was terminated, and waldann once more could travel among worlorn's dominions, and live. 


 however, while waldann had been seeking his fortune elsewhere, strange and wonderous events had occurred in worlorn. the golden dragon road had grown more talons, for now there were over thirty dominions of worlorn! without exception, all the old worlds had been released by the dragon and lost in the chaos sea, and four new worlds had replaced each of the old dominions! 


 in the chaos of this new worlorn, waldann's memory was insufficient to plot a safe course, and his road map was not wielded. waldann lost control of his chariot, and in the accident waldann lost his concentration, releasing the domain called the glove box into the sea of chaos. 


 fortunately waldann's wonderous road map was able to cope with the strangeness of worlorn, and properly displayed the routes between the many new worlds of worlorn. the road map allowed waldann's magic bus to drive a proper course between the talons of the dragon road. 


 although waldann's glove box was lost to the sea of chaos, waldann regained his powers of concentration and was able to dominate another world within a very short time. for his new dominion, waldann wanted to regain his freedom from the world dragon's grasp, but did not wish to establish dominion over a world which could fall into the sea of chaos. 


 to fulfill both of these goals, waldann studied the road map carefully, and took control of the territory between the  [dominions](dominions.md) . never again would waldann lose his dominion to the sea of chaos, for he dominated the very scales of the golden dragon's back which made up the golden road! 


 in the new worlorn surrounded by chaos, waldann high-ironjade x dominates all trade routes on the back of the golden dragon road between worlorn dominions.
