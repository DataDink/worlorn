### Roland

alleged Dancer for Blood

Jorie and Seth often discuss a baffling riddle, parts of which should be apparent to Roland. For instance, they just don't understand how anyone can bear a sword and lamp, and still have two empty hands.

"His first Move.

 "Blood visits the tower 

 "bearing His sword and the Red Light.

 "Who that places

 "In Blood's empty hands

 "the armor of His new home,

 "Who that answers 

 "His questions three,

 "may choose the blade or lamp

 "and with it 

 "the course of Worlorn 

 "for generations."
