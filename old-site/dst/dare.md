# Daralyn Talisman

first dancer

### From ricercar Wed Nov 6 00:55:36 1996

 *Dare dances the first part of the Senethar, with personal variations, in front of the dying flame, just for di Griz.*
>
>   Kneeling in no-space, during *time out of mind* after Dare finishes the Senethar for the hope of di Griz, Daralyn is confronted by a **mind** outside her own. **She** wrenches Daralyn from the rightful peace which Dare invariably earns through dance, **She** tears Daralyn from Nirvana by the mere fact **Her** attention is fallen upon Dare.
>
>   An entity momentarily interposes himself between **Her** and Dare, but he is **thrown aside**, as an old frisbee winged across the room, by a child who is grabbing for a newer surprise from daddy.
>
>   **She** commands the rag-doll: ***flee poet***!
>
>   Then **She** is a solid wall of will, slamming full-force into Dare's unbuffered psyche: as buckshot through tissue, as a semi-truck through a billboard, as an avalanche pummelling a log cabin into oblivion.

> Terpsichore does not
> know you. name
> your teacher! where are
> you from? you are not
> from first turf of Klinure!?
> deceived! you serve
> no Sister of mine!
> 
> Dancer:
> answer me or Dance for me!
>
>   Daralyn awakens, not refreshed from the Senethar as expected, but instead wakens aching as if she danced all night, wakens on a cot in the hut of a very frightened Josie of Musquel.
