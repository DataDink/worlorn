# Daralyn Talisman



first dancer

### From ricercar Wed Nov 6 00:55:36 1996

 *Dare dances the first part of the Senethar, with personal variations, in front of the dying flame, just for di Griz.*

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Kneeling in no-space, during *time out of mind* after Dare finishes the Senethar for the hope of di Griz, Daralyn is confronted by a **mind** outside her own. **She** wrenches Daralyn from the rightful peace which Dare invariably earns through dance, **She** tears Daralyn from Nirvana by the mere fact **Her** attention is fallen upon Dare.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  An entity momentarily interposes himself between **Her** and Dare, but he is **thrown aside**, as an old frisbee winged across the room, by a child who is grabbing for a newer surprise from daddy.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **She** commands the rag-doll: ***flee poet***!

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Then **She** is a solid wall of will, slamming full-force into Dare's unbuffered psyche: as buckshot through tissue, as a semi-truck through a billboard, as an avalanche pummelling a log cabin into oblivion.
