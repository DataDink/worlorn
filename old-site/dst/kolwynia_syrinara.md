![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [history](history.md)  evidence suggests the dark angel syrinara used the Key That Was Lost during the  [dreams](dreams.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  it is patently obvious that no dark angel could achieve [21st level]; therefore, we must assume this record is a concatenation of three invocations by a dark angel permanently trapped in kharst [7th level].
