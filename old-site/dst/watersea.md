  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Watersea is an ocean to separate the ground-based dominions. Typically a Dominion has few Watersea Ports, with the majority of sea travel possible only within the wastelands about its own borders. A special vessel, called a "ship of the sea," is required to sail between dominions on the Watersea, but any ocean going vessel can sail within the Watersea Isles and return to it's home Watersea Port.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Watersea has no major continents, although the waves are dotted with uncountable islands. Populations are isolated and commerce tends to occur only within the confines of a given archipelago. There is great society below the waves, with mer-races and sahuagin constantly warring for supremacy on the lands below the sea.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Llewella of Muili** is a mage of great power who wrested dominance of the Watersea from  [prince1000](prince1000.md)  after Patterfall. She is a pale skinned woman of a certain height and slim build. Her hair is green, and she prefers to wear blue and teal. Her voice and gaze are direct, her manner abrupt, and she suffers no fools to waste her time. She likes to sing and play the harp, but rarely in public. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Llewella is one of the daughters of  [dworkin](dworkin.md)  and the mother of  [eressea](eressea.md) . While Llewella was not one of the original nine princes(ses), she was a whim of Prince Brand ratified by Oberon.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Although Llewella's court is in the undersea city of Muili, her chosen people are air-breathers, a warrior race created by Aleksander, and known to themselves as Islanders. Islanders are the major populace of Watersea Isles. They are dark-haired arabic sorts. They have negative psionic ability ("Type 6") but excell above the norm in any spellcraft. They are deadly fighters, tending towards use of curved blades such as scimitars, tulwars, and cutlasses.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Islanders have a theocratic society, and despite the dispersed culture, they believe in one godking leader ruling from the island in the center of the universe. The godking is the current reincarnation of Semandros, the being who led them from the waves. The women are rarely soldiers, for the Islanders revere the blood of women as holy. Female Islander warriors are never opposed on the battlefield by Islander males. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Each Watersea Archipelago is lead by three holy justices, the Ephors, who may be male or female. Although many Ephors are not priests, an Ephor's judgement is the Word of the God. Two Ephors are required to lead another Ephor to the waves.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Islanders believe they are the chosen ones of God, and treat other races as inferior. They have stringent codes and judgements for the treatment of non-Islander races, ranging from unrecognized-nonsentients with no social rights, through civilized-and-sentient-but-not-Islander races with which trading and commerce is permitted.
