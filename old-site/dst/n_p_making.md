>   The initial incarnation of the Maker was a short stone man named Champion Eternal. The church of the Maker was founded on this Avatar. It is said Champion came from another world to Worlorn, pulling a War Wagon brimming full of his handicrafts. It is said Champion went away with the Mistress of Abandoned Dreams, but is continued to be worshipped by Stone Brothers who were alive in his time, Made by his hand on his Anvil. 
>
>   The current incarnation of the Maker is much more fun. Damon Eternal is a flesh and blood incarnation, one who understands all sorts of appetites. Damon likes to party on. Making Love and Making Fights and Making metal things are his main pleasures. 
>
>   The Maker carries a huge hammer or axe as he Makes his way through life. It is said the first hammer he made is Smasher. His second hammer is Basher, which he carries to this day. The third hammer will be Made at the End of the World, to be called Crasher.

>   Huldra Folk and Stone Brothers Make hearty fighters and loyal companions.

>   A dwarf tends to Make is own armor and some even Make their weapons.

>   Followers of the Maker tend to be lawful citizens of whatever city they be in. They value the goodness of life and beauty, for these things are Made possible by their deity. 
>
>   Don't be evil. Don't Make them come over there to hurt you.

>   Some legends have Kaldama’aren as the Hall of the God, other legends say this is the name of the Anvil of Making. While both Kaldama’arens are undoubtedly the high holy places to the Church of the Maker, both are relatively inaccessible in the Heart of the Earth, so the deity Made another High Altar which Makes its home in the Huldra community of Mountain Home.

>   Gondemar leads the Stone Brothers as living Godking, from his temple in Hidden Valley. 
>
>   Durathor, son of Gondemar, leads the Huldra Folk as High Priest in Mountain Home.

>   Stone Brothers are made of rock and stone, neither breathing, nor eating, nor having other appetites of the body. Champion Eternal is not known to have Made any female dwarves or understood what they might represent. 
>
>   Damon Eternal Makes wimmen as well as menfolk on his Blue-Eyed Anvil. Life is more pleasant among Damon Maker's Huldrafolk than among dour Stone Brothers, at least to the eye of outsiders. 
>
>   Stone Brothers tend to disdain the company of elves, due to a falling out of Champion Eternal with an incarnation of the Phoenix. Huldrafolk appear to get along well with elves as well as all manner of folk. Damon Eternal and the Phoenix Blacksword are travelling buddies. 
>
>   It is said that the Maker Made the Well of Time, a place where even  [tiresias](tiresias.md)  cannot pass. In reward, Tiresias allowed Champion to Make Stone Brothers immune to the passage of time. While Immune to aging, death comes to Stone Brothers if they break in such a manner that repair is not possible. This is known not to be true for Huldra Folk, and much of the church schism centers on the benefots of each culture.
