Threnody Speaks on Morgan

```

The legends of Morgan are long and varied and colorful. 

I...would have liked to meet her.

She was a half-elf, half silver dragon daughter child of Remo and Miranes
Gatmirk (Miranes, who went to Lemuria). Her eyes were silver-grey, and 
they could enthrall or kill without her trying. Her hair was yellow-blonde, 
and she wore it straight and long and free. Her hair was Morgan's only
vanity, despite her Bird training and great beauty.

She was born a resident of Elidor and grew up there until adolescence.
Ironically, a dark angel student of Remo named Padrig kidnapped Morgan 
from her castle and sold her to Madame Bird to be trained and used 
as a concubine. Some say of all the women who passed through Bird keep, 
Morgan was the only adolescent who was accepted for full Bird training. 

She was assigned by Madame Bird to a mage of great power, Salt Peter, who 
is said to have usurped the first Necrodemus Emperor after creating the 
Empire's throne. But it was well before this time that Morgan la Faye and
Salt Peter first met, and in the beginning of their relationship they 
used each other's powers harshly. There was no love lost. Each tore from
the other whatever acclaim and power they could. Morgan and Salt Peter
lived in a Place of Power she granted to him, because she needed one but
didn't desire to be tied to one. Salt Peter garnered all four elemental 
powers and eventually the Ring of Fire from Morgan's help. They were a
fitting pair, each using each other mercilessly for their own personal gain.

It was not long before Morgan's fate would take her on her own path, away 
from the mage. A coven-druid or bard is said to have stolen her heart and 
when she bore the fellow's child, Salt Peter cast Morgan out of his house. 

She began seeking protections, and it was this time that she secured the 
Blue Star and the Illusionist's orb from Justin Time, both of which Morgan 
Mastered to great effect later in her life and used immediately to protect 
her child.

Sources trace Morgan's path to a small cabin in Velvet Green forest where
she raised a boy-child under the care of her great grandfather Llewellyn 
ap-Owen. Other sources say the boy-child Silverfox was raised at Elidor, 
in Castle Gorias just like his mother, and only went to the forest cabin
later.

When the Great Smith Aeol came to her and asked Morgan to help with his 
vision of weapons to deliver a Real Death from which there was no appeal
or return, she was tempted away from her peaceful family life. Despite
Llewellyn's objections, she left the child in his care and left retirement
to help make the name Morganti one of the world's terrors. For almost
five years she studied with Aeol before they made the weapons. For over
two years they forged the weapons for an invited and select few.
Soon after, Helen the Dark slew Morgan with Anglachel. Threnody shakes 
his head, Never kill anyone with a blade they gave to you. Especially 
if it was Morgan la Faye that gave it to you. This was the last time Helen 
was able to wield Anglachel in combat. 

Remo is said to have discovered the body. He unearthed living rock and carved 
her tombstone without any tools, not leaving the site until she was buried.
Salt Peter is said to have exhumed her body but was set upon by maurauders
and he lost the wu hsin he came for. Eressea and Almitra eventually 
recovered Morgan's Wu hsin from Salt Peter or Nemesis and the two women 
broke Morgan Free. She was not herself for a while, and some say she was 
severely damaged mentally from all the time she spent in the Wu hsin trying 
not to be consumed. Almitra spent years teaching Morgan to participate in
the world once again. I hear her son never visited her in all that time.

When an unrecorded danger overcame the guardians at Gorias, Almitra and
Eressea watched Morgan fly as a Dragon away from Elidor and lost track of 
her for many years. It may have been a party of Hellene Drow trying to 
finish what their queen had started with Anglachel. Forcing Morgan into 
Dragon form may have been permanently damaging to her recovering 
human psyche; a dragon is not the most humane or empathic of creatures...

Morgan next recovered the Muse and made a plane near Dolbadarn with 
Llewellyn ap-Owen. they called it Novus Mundi, or New World. When 
Severian smuggled his Morganti weapon into Novus Mundi, the two creators 
had a falling out, since Llewellyn couldn't be convinced that Morgan broke 
a promise about forbidding Real Death in Novus Mundi. 

It's rumoured that Llewellyn threw Morgan into the sea of chaos, where she 
could do nothing but preserve her own identity. It was near this time that 
the DeathGod Yama was slain and Llewellyn was reborn anew, at first level, 
and with no memories of his past, so he could not even know to rescue Morgan 
from his anger. 

This was some three decades ago. There have been some sightings of a silver 
dragon off-shore in the sea of Flux, but I've never seen it...

Threnody breaks off the tale and leaves Dolbadarn for a while, to stare 
out over the silver waves of the Sea of Chaos.

Marlee adds some flesh to Threnody's naked tale

```

She was born a resident of Elidor and grew up there 
until adolescence.

Time, Flowing like a river
Time, Beckoning me
Who knows when we shall meet again
If ever
But time 
Keeps flowing like a river
To the sea
Goodbye my friends, Maybe forever
Goodbyr my friends, The TIde waits for me
Who knows when we shall meet again
If Ever
But Time
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)
To the Sea, to the sea
Till it's gone forever
Gone Forevermore
Goodbye my friends, maybe forever
Goodbye my friends, the stars wait for me
Who knows when we shall meet again
If ever
But Time 
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)
To the sea, to the sea
Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forevremore

Some say of all the women who passed through Bird keep,
Morgan was the only adolescent who was accepted for full Bird training. 

Eye's of Light with flowing hair
All that passes for fair
she takes her fan and throws it into the Lion's den
"which or you to gain me tell would risk uncertain pains of hell?"
The sailor gave atleast a try 
the soldier was much to wise 
stratagie was his strenght and not abandon...

Morgan la Faye and Salt Peter first met, and in the 
beginning of their relationship they used each other's 
powers harshly.

She had psychic defences
He had Animal Dreams
they moved closer together 
He said "Let's make a deal"
Does not the law forbid it
It's a treacherous act
We all must suffer
We all must do our part
No one knows how it started
And God knows how it'll end
The fighting continues
Women Vs Men
Women have there ways 
Men we have ours 
We're into sports
They're into flowers
The women are talking
We do not understand
They speak in a language
We do not comprehend
No onw knows how it started 
And God knows how it'll end
The fighting continues 
Women vs Men
Fightin' in the parkin'lots
Is this how it'll end?
Armies of ladies 
Fightin' armies of men?
So you'd better be careful
should one cross your path
One innocent movement
And It could be your last

A coven-druid or bard is said to have stolen her heart

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the Sun in his jeolous sky
As we walk in fields of gold
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as the Her hair came down 
Among the fields of gold
Will you stay with me will you Be my love?
Among the fields of Barley?
We'll forget the sun in his Jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley 
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly 
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We'll walk in fields of gold

She began seeking protections,... the Blue Star and the 
Illusionist's orb...used immediately to protect her child.

She knows that I've been doing something wrong
But she wont say anything
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday
But she wont mind me lying
mhmmm 'cause
Mother stands for comfort
Mother hide the murderer
It breaks the cage, fear escape an take possesion
Just like the crowd rioting inside
Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this
Make  me do that --
Am I the cat that takes the bird??
To her the hunted, not the hunter.
Mother stands for comfort 
Mother will hide the murderer
Mother hides the madman
Mother will stay Mum

When the Great Smith Aeol came to her and asked Morgan 
to help with his vision of weapons to deliver a Real 
Death from which there was no appealor return, she was 
tempted away from her peaceful family life 

Among twenty snowy mountains
the only thing moving 
Was the eye of a blackbird
I was of three minds
Like a tree
In which there are three Blackbirds
The blackbird whirled in the autuumn winds
It was a small part of the pantomime
a man and a woman 
Are one
A man and a woman and a blackbird 
Are one
I do not know which to prefer
The beauty of inflections 
Or the beauty of innuendoes
The blackbird whistling
Or just after
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass
The shadow of the bleckbird
Crossed it to and fro
The mood 
Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause
Oh thin men of Haddam
Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird 
Walks around the feet 
Of the women around you?
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms:
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know
When the blackbird flew out of sight
It marked the edge
Of one of many Circles
At the site of blackbirds
Flying in green light
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach
Once, a fear pierced him
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds
The river is moving
The blackbird must be flying
It was evening all afternoon
It was snowing
And it was going to snow
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs

Remo is said to have found the body

Under the dog star sail
Over the reefs of moonshine
Under the skies of fall
North, north west, the stones of Faroe
Under the Arctic fire
Over the seas of silence
Hauling on frozen ropes 
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?
All colourts bleed to red 
Asleep on the ocean's bed
Drifting in empty seas 
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?
Dark Angels follow me 
Over a godless sea
Mountains of endless falling,
For all my days remaining
What would be true?
Sometimes I see your face
They stars seem to lose their place
Why must I think of you?
Why must I?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?
Why would you want me to?
And what would it mean to say,
That, "I loved you in my fashion"?
What would be true?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?

Salt Peter is said to have exhumed her body but was set 
upon by maurauders and he lost the wu hsin 

{marlee laughs}

Eressea and Almitra eventually recovered Morgan's Wu hsin, 
and the two women broke Morgan Free 

you wont burn You wont bleed -- confess to me girl
Go down
poor little thing
blackbird 
wings in the water -- go down
What is it child?
Bless me, Bless me father for I have sinned...
I question your innocence
Help this blackbird there's a stone around my leg
She's a which
Help this blackbird there's a stone around my leg
What say you good people 
GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
I am responcible for your actions
Wake the witch!

yellow bird flying gets shot in the wing good year for hunters and christmas
parties and i hate and i hate and i hate elevator music the way we fight the
way i'm left here silent 

oh these little earthquakes here we go again these little earthquakes doesn't
take much to rip us into pieces

we danced in the graveyard with vampires until dawn we laughed in the faces
of kings never afraid to burn and i hate and i hate and i hate and i hate

disintigration watching us wither black winged roses that safely change their
colour i can't reach you i can't reach you give me life give me pain give me
my self again give me life give me pain give me myself again give me life
give me pain give me myself again...

>Morgan next recovered the Muse and made a plane near 
>Dolbadarn with Llewellyn ap-Owen. they called it Novus 
>Mundi, or New World 

Welcom to my life 
There's no turning back 
Even while we sleep
Help me make the most of freedom
and of pleasure nothing ever lasts forever everybody wants to rule the world

where she could do nothing but preserve her own identity.

Like a ghost- is the curtain
in the white light of the morning
dancing in the morning
are you there - are you there?
And the shadow - like a sadness
falling all across the garden
dancing in the garden 
Are you there, are you there?
Shine on, friend, goodnight
Why then the darkening of the light
And the leaves at my feet 
whisper sounds so familiar
whisper so familiar -
Are you there, are you there?
Shine on, friend hole tight 
why then the darkening of the light
Where the clouds pull apart
and moon changes faces
in the quiet secret places
Are you there are you there?
Shine on, friend hole tight 
why then the darkening of the light
