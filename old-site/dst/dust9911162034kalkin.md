# preparations for war



 a request of Yama Dharma

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Greetings to the High Death God Yama Dharma from his loyal son and servant Kalkin. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I have a request of you at this time. Is it possible that you have a suit of Elfin Chain from our former home, that being Knock? If so, I would greatly appreciate a chance to view this non-magical light-weight armor within the confines of The Fountainhead for but a few minutes. If possible, many thanks and spoils await you in times to be.
