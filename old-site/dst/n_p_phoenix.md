 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Phoenix has two avatars, one each for separate Aspects of Rebirth and Fire. It is important to note that unike most deities with multiple avatars, the Phoenix often incarnates both the  [blacksword](blacksword.md)  avatar and  [threnody](threnody.md)  avatar *simultaneously*, without apparent resentment or repercussions from other deities. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is believed that while the Deathgod is respected for his place at the end of the  [mortalcoil](mortalcoil.md) , the Phoenix is held in highest regard because even powerful deities need to be reborn on occasion.
