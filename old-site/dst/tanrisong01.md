 Brilliance in Port Suame

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  *It may have happened this way. I was not there. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  When I chanced upon Orland Fank in a later life, I asked him whether the Runestaff aiding Tanri's song had cost him the favor of the Deathgod. He asked me, *“Who is Tanri Silverharp?”* 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Listen, Learn, and Ponder. * -Threnody 
 
########  





########  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanri Silverharp awakens to the sounds of  [dust9911191114yama](dust9911191114yama.md) . Throwing open the shutters on her bedroom window, she sees streets full of running soldiers: men and women in red chainmail effortlessly rounding up the lawful  [necrodemus](necrodemus.md)  Bronzers and city populace. The Red Army is forcing all people indoors without qualms against—or orders favoring—killing. They are giving the same treatment to citizen and soldier alike, drawing red axes only when there is resistance. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Without recalling the transition, Tanri finds herself downstairs at the door to the map room.  is sitting, and  [sharra](sharra.md)  blocks the door. Sharra is not happy, and Maja appears in no better mood. The only sound is scrimmage on the streets. After a moment Sharra steps aside and lets Tanri enter. The women are alone. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The map of the city has a new black circle drawn on it. Two previous circles in red and blue, represented the radii of two Places of Power as perceived by Maja and Derrick. The new circle is twice the diameter of Maja’s, centered on her High Temple, the Telesterion of Brilliance. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja says, “We are attacked by the forces of the  [deathgod](deathgod.md) . His general, the Grand Moff Tarkin, commands the Death Star, the Tomb of Black Vannik, When the Arch Lich accompanied Necrodemus I as they conquered this continent, Vannik assembled a  [dragonbones](dragonbones.md)  collection of immense evil power, a “flying buffalo” floating castle incorporating death's High Telesterion Temple within a mobile two-flag Place of Power. Tarkin controls more probabilities than Derrick and I together, at nearly twice my range. Tarkin commands Vannik's atrocity from a hundred yards above the city and has demanded the surrender of the High Telesterion to Brilliance.” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra adds. “The Death Star threatens with a plasma cannon that sprays vaporized iron perhaps a mile. This power is peer to the Fires at my command. Tarkin knows that I’m here. If he attacks, we both know it will be a mutual **Destruction**.” Maja winces, and unbelievably pales even more. The women fall into rapid conversation about details that Tanri can barely follow. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “What can I do?” interrupts Tanri. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra starts to shake er head, freezes, and then begins to grin, a dark, macabre sort of smile. A rictus. Tanri has to look away. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Why don’t you sing Tarkin a song?” Sharra says slowly. “A carefully chosen song, penetrating with your Darkling harp throughout the radius of Maja’s Place of Power to persuade Tarkin to your point of view. A song about something that will change their minds about attacking.” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I don’t care about who wears the Bronze here,” says Maja, “but *
 **By the Runestaff**, we will fry under their goddamn cannon before a single priestess of Brilliance lays down her Sunblade in Port Suame

*
 !

” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “You stupid bitch," Sharra cries, “I warned you about the Runestaff!” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja looks belligerent, unrepentant. The mood is tense. Tanri says, “Them, not us.” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Both women blink, smile tightly, and blush. Sharra touches Maja's hand, and Maja says, "Tart" to Sharra. They share a smile, and the discussion continues. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Presently Tanri finds a song that appeals to her.

>Every line has a Worlorn interpretation to Tanri
>let me know if you need to know her Intent/interpretation 

```

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra looks intrigued at this choice but Maja looks alarmed by the lyrics. “This sounds like I’m giving up to Tarkin, committing suicide.” 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra says to Tanri, while looking mostly at Maja, “Why don’t you deconstruct the lyric for us. What does it Inspire in you? Annotate this song line by line and tell us what you’re going to be thinking as you sing the song, and then we’ll have a common connotation to discuss.” 





```

```

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanri says, “Okay... here, at least, is the interpretation of the first song I would like to sing. I’ll consider others in the meantime. Keep in mind, Maja, that I would sing this from my perspective, not yours. You are not ‘falling’, and you are not weakened. And, from my perspective, neither am I.” A gentle smile. “No more than in any other circumstance I’ve run into here.”

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Is that clearer, my friends?” asks Tanri. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra and Maja sit at the table in the Map Room to listen to Tanri’s explanation of her song. When Tanri finishes, they remain still, heads bowed, as if they study their hands clasped in their laps. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Finally Sharra blinks and looks up to Tanri, but then she sits with open mouth, cannot find words. She smiles and shrugs, still speechless. Maja is the first to speak. She faces Tanri and a tear breaks from each of her blue eyes. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I am sorry to have doubted you. Please forgive me. Your song will undoubtedly prevail against the Grand Moff and the Church of Death.” 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  She hugs Tanri and rushes from the room. Sharra smiles, and rises to hug Tanri also. 





 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  *So it came to pass that Tanri lifted Tarkin’s doom from the worshippers of Mother Brilliance. Nolerak Larethian was not the first deity to pause when Tanri Silverharp sang.* -T
