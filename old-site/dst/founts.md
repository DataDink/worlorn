 Tanngrisner talks with Salt Peter and they have figured out the why of the Fountains of Paradise. 


 The Fountains of Paradise is powered by the Star of Beauty [of the Courts of Chaos]. This is why people are stunned by its beauty upon arrival there. A person would need Star or Stone from the Courts to enter the Fountains of Paradise and not be dazed by the beauty until distracted. 


 The Fountains of Paradise is a place where Llewellyn and/or Threnody COULD make turf, but have not. It is a potential of which Threnody likely is aware, but has not pursued out of his blood affiliation. It appears Llewellyn was pursuing affinity with the Star of Fire rather than the Star of Beauty. 


 Tanngrisner notes "Llewellyn must have decided bearing both Stars was a bad idea without proper training. Maybe he didn't even think it was possible to bear two Stars in Worlorn." Tangrisner blinks, and smiles weakly. 


 "Good thing Threnody didn't have the three Stones on Troy's Charm bracelet to study for for long, or he might have figured out how to bear two Stars from the Courts of Chaos. There might have been some Beautiful fires... or some pretty Destructive ones. It's probably for the best that the bracelet was Destroyed. I willingly give up my chance for Troad to keep from having Threnody own Two of the other chances for Turf."
