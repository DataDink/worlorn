# sibling rivalry



second dream of taimarra

The Elves of Light surround you, but the Kimdiss stands aside. One by one they remove their headbands, each of the five elves, and begin to squeeze them, wring them out into a wooden bowl.
 "What price?" asks Ryndall. "How will you pay for the flesh?"


 "After all we;ve done for you," says one-hand.


 "Full fathom five, my father lies." says the holy man, wringing his headband to the last moisture. The liquid from his headband is stained pink, with your blood. Alone of all the Lios Elfar, the Priest Marcellus ties his headband back around his head.


 "We've helped you. How can you repay us?" asks the Queen. Her hand is on her sword. With her bald head and your Doomgiver clothes, She looks like Doctor Scofflaw ready to begin torturing one of his prisoners.


 Hoosker just stares at you, untying his headband, and flips it into the bowl without wringing it out.


 "We're finished here." says the leader, Ryndall. They start to walk into the marsh, away from you. The Kimdiss has finished packing away all the belongings, those of the elves plus your own, into his own bedroll. The Kimdiss called Crimson puts your Chest of Bottles on the magic disk. He looks apologetically towards you, shrugging while walking backwards as the band walks away from you, into the blizzard. Crimson waves once.


 You let them go, bending down over the bowl of liquid. You can see your face in the bowl, like a mirror. You see the face change from yours to your sister's over the course of a minute or ten. Dark hair turns to light, thin cheeks fill into a round face. She's speaking to you, Sam's saying something special you need to hear. "What?" you ask. "I can't hear you," you cry.


 "Don't let them get away." says the Doctor, at your side. "How can I find them if you're not with them?" You draw your weapon and dance it into a sword, to cut. It won't keep him away forever, but cuts always make him go away. Doctor Scofflaw stands there smiling as you cut off his head. His smile doesn't change as you slice his neck, not as he falls face down into the snow, and not as his headless body reaches down to pick up his head from the snowdrift. "We're finished here," says the evil Doctor, while holding his head on his shoudlers again. "You need to leave."


 You turn to flee, and bump into Diswal. She plucks up the bowl from the air as you drop it. You dance the Weapon into the axe, and slice her arm Instead of her wrist, your own shatters into bones and blood. She looks into the bowl, oblivious of your attack. "Hey" Diswal cries, "Sam asked for **ogre** sweat, not Elf!' She glares at you, dumping the bowl into the snow where the pink waters mingle with drops of your blood. "You know what happens when Sam gets mad."


 Diswal turns into Samantha, shapeshifting before you. ""Dearest sister," she says. Her smile is the same as Doctor Scofflaw, her eyes the same as the one armed elf. From a scabbard on her belt, Sam draws a sword made out of wood. "My dear sister, you've failed me again..." she moves close, and you cannot move.


 "No," you cry. "I really tried!"


 "We're finished here," she says. "Say hello to Mother and Father for me." Samantha lifts the sword above her head and brings the blade down, slashing, towards your face.
