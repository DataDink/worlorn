# Ko, *the lost *



 Klinure’s Laureate **Revealed**

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ko was the *Greater God of Improvement* from a world called *Crosstime*. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ko came to  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  nearly simultaneously with the first outworlder, an incarnation of  [troy](troy.md)  now known as  [dworkin](dworkin.md) . Together they explored all of Worlorn, discovering only Dominions of Slaver Races such as Dactyloids, Hee-Chee, Hruun, Mara, Mind Flayers, Slaad, Sleeth,  [thrint](thrint.md) , and Titans. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Dismayed by the world-wide slavery, Ko joined Dworkin and three subsequent arrivals on Worlorn:  [knock](knock.md) ,  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md) , and  [yama](yama.md) . We set aside all personal goals to free the slaves. These were gruelling decades of guerrilla action, testing inadequate hypothesis, failures and retreats, decades that became centuries. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It was only Ko who refused to accept the  [muses](muses.md)  as Troy threatened to leave Worlorn. After some tense hours in private discussion, Troy agreed to remain as  [oberon](oberon.md) , and they returned to us laughing. Like Troy, all of us, Yama, Knock, Llewellyn, every one remembers reaching our limits, moments when we would have packed it in and gone home, were it not for Ko’s encouragement and unflagging devotion to the oppressed. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  After 4444 years we had finally developed sufficient Mastery of  [wildmagic](wildmagic.md)  to make weapons by which we carved  [earthsea](earthsea.md) , a set of free , separate and unassailable, where the former slaves could Dominate their own fates. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ko and six others eventually become known as *the Seven Elder Protogods* by the races we freed. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ko established  [roke](roke.md)  Island as First Archmage, and then dropped from human ken. For eighteen millenia thereafter, Ko fell into obscurity on Worlorn. Apparently *uninspired* for the first four Cycles, Ko’s personal ambitions were **Revealed** only by Klinure, the  [muses](muses.md)  of  [dreams](dreams.md) . Despite being *er-per’henne* in the Cycle of Dreams, we believe Ko aspired to be Poet of Dreams and attempted to earn Klinure’s Laureate Wreath. However, whether from pride or humility, Ko never spoke of his candidacy to anyone. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Whatever Inspired him, Ko Revealed himself and became deity for all sorts of *Iahklu* in that Cycle. The priests Karlon Krons and Serge Gorodish are perhaps the most well-known Dreamers to worshop Ko. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  All Poets of earlier Cycles believe that Ko had a successful candidacy, and was rewarded with Klinure’s Wreath. Whether from pride or humility, Ko never spoke of this to anyone.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Also at the conclusion of the Cycle of Dreams,  [erin](erin.md)  Ko Mori No Te, sent the Named Wrathman Crotoan to slay  [yama](yama.md) . We do not have the exact Words of Erin’s  [crotoan](crotoan.md) , but we believe that Ko heard those Words and lay down Klinure’s wreath to—in some unknown manner—assume the role of Worlorn’s  [deathgod](deathgod.md)  before, during, or after Yama’s Passing, or perhaps to sacrifice himself to the Wrathman in Yama’s place as some sort of regent Deathgod. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Having seen all magic leave one world upon the defeat of its Lord of Death, Ko must have realized the repercussions of Erin’s irrevocable action, and did *Whatever It Takes *to ensure magic remained on Worlorn. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  One  [paths](paths.md)  persists regarding these times, but neither Wedge nor any of us have the complete telling, for Yama and Threnody claim amnesia from these times. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  There was a  [archmage](archmage.md)  who puzzled things together, but it deciphered the clues too late to save Ko. We believe that that Sethra Lavode went to  [musquel](musquel.md)  and *Destroyed* Ko’s last avatar *Piscator* while Ko was detained elsewhere as the Deathgod. The disposition of Ko’s focus, the Golden Bowl of the Buddha, has never been Revealed. Ko’s familiar, a giant beaver, has never been seen in Worlorn. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  We Poets of earlier cycles,  [troy](troy.md) ,  [shelgrim](shelgrim.md) , and  [tiresias](tiresias.md) , have come to believe that Ko earned and set aside Klinure’s Wreath the same year. No previous cycle has terminated without loss of Key, Compact, or one of the other sublime Matters of Consequence. We have never lost a Poet; however, the Cycle of Dance is well underway and we have not yet observed a Poet to wield the Dreaming Laureate’s Wreath. 







 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ko remains known to Worlorn each time we Improve ourselves or our circumstances.
