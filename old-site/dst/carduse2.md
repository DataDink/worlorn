Executive Summary
-----------------
To keep your gold cards under the compact, people without brownsheets have
to stay inside their turfs and not invite any other gold card weilders in.
Description of the problem
--------------------------
Unless you have a special brownsheet Nostoi character sheet or unless you
have a permanently laminated character sheet, your True Name is changable,
and you cannot safely use colored cards ON AN ADVENTURE.
Since half Oimota's 16 Domaintors are not laminated or brownsheet, this
means eight PC&NPCs are not able to leave your turfs and gain experience or
roll diced encounters. Thus the recent Compact seems to have some folks
locked inside their turfs.
You are in no danger as long as you stay inside your turfs and/or don't
have to roll dice.
Thought Exercise
----------------
(a) The Compact says the Compact is invoked by someone
    beginning an adventure or by someone with a gold card.
    [11.1-7.1, 11.1-2.2, 11.7.2]
(b) The Compact says only brownsheet Nostoi [AKA people who have
    escaped from Hissarlik] can weild colored cards.
    [11.8.1, 11.8.7, 11.8.11, 11.8.17]
	 
(c) The Compact says when you're in your turfs you are not on an
    adventure.
    [8.x.7]
a + b =
    When an adventure begins in your turf, on demand of any participant or
    observer, turfholders MUST use their gold cards to 'wake up' the
    Compact in order for the Compact to punish all non-Nostoi for weilding
    a colored card. Thus, the Compact says even inside her own turf
    a non-Nostoi turfweilder MUST use her own gold card to make the
    Compact punish her for being non-Nostoi.
a + c =
    Non-Nostoi can avoid the fate by forbidding ALL adventures within
    your own turf.

The High One says:
"What this Book does now is make sure no riff-raff can go aroun' and messin' up
 people's turf. I set up the book to keep everyone locked in at home for a
 bit, to prevent lootin' and vandalizin' until we get the world
 straightened up."
"I'm worried about the people in the book with more than one goldcard.
 I don't wanna take away all the old rules, that's like throwin' the baby out
 with the bathwater. I also don't want people to be able to use the book to
 beat each other up. So what I did was write a chapter that keeps people at
 home until I get things more safe."
"If I throwed out all the olden-days rules, we'd all be limited to only the
 cards and abilities we have right now [to show the DM] today. I was
 thinkin' that in order to re-create the old world better, we have to keep
 the old ways as much as possible, at least until we can stop a while and
 think it over about what the rule are we wants to keep around and which
 ones we want to toss out for good."
"Now I can't stop you now from Makin' a change if you see that we need one.
 All I ask is that you figger out what will Make everyone happy before you
 Make a mistake or Make a questionable difference."
