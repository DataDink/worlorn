  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Kalkin allows any iahklu or *er-per’henne* a Safe Haven within the Fountainhead, especially those who have no place to go. Any entity which has dreams under the  [dreams](dreams.md)  may exist in the Fountainhead. Kalkin the Binder explicitly invites those mentioned in the Compacts. However, the Talisman of the Binder sustains Morganti Real Death and Kalkin therefore explicitly disavows Morganti Victims the rights to dream within the Fountainhead.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Compact is still enforced within the Fountainhead, as are Billykin's laws, Blood Law, Dust Law, and Tiresias'  [elidor](elidor.md)  Laws. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Upon entering the Fountainhead, entities enter a valley providing full accomodations for their stay. Spell research and item enchantment are allowed, as well as training advancement. Non-magical materials are provided for research and training. Food is also provided. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Adventuring conditions resemble those availble in Hissarlik Life Hutches. Fighting is **not** permitted within the Valley. Priests may receive spells of advanced level if they consecrate a High Altar.  [cards](cards.md)  operate as expected. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Billykin's world artifacts are permanently confiscated upon arrival in the Fountainhead. No other imported property is disturbed by local conditions.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Entities may come and go from the turf freely. Actions where the integrity of the Gold Card Turf is at risk are considered hostile and the [entity/entities] are deported from the Fountainhead, and forbidden entry without invitation from the turfwielder. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Lands beyond the valley can be seen from the peaks surrounding the valley. To the south is a river, the west continues mountainous, east holds plains, and north is the view of an overgrown Washington DC, consumed by jungle except for a few visible monuments.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Any entity who chooses to leave the valley for the lands beyond no longer exists, within the sight of the High One. Before they leave the valley entities are given a premonition that they are leaving Worlorn.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) two legends exist for the talisman of the binder. the favored description is a belt of ten shells, nine with power to bind to the wielder's will one rank of supernatural effect and one for binding psionic activity. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the second possibility is kalkin's talisman of the binder: an ivory rod to which are bound six wrathmen, released to do kalkin's bidding *no matter what*. 

 
 **the high one** on the talisman of the binder:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **talisman of the binder** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *binding* in worlorn, including but not limited to manicles that tie and bind, binding oaths, binding magics, and binding souls.
