### **use**



invoking a colored card





  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **invoking a colored card** is achieved by thought and will of the possessor, with no physical activity required. possession of a colored card allows the possessor to 

* make one item (as described on the colored card) per uninterrupted minute of concentration
* unmake one item (as described on the card) per uninterrupted minute of concentration.
* destroy all white cards (as described on the card) with one uninterrupted minute of concentration



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **dreamers** do not have the ability to weild colored cards without a true name, regardless of iahklu (player) or *er-per’henne* (NPC) status.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **monsters** may carry colored cards but may not invoke them to produce white cards, regardless of iahklu or *er-per’henne* status.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **nostoi ** (brownsheet) characters may carry colored cards and invoke them to produce white cards at the rate of once per round, with no harm. the nostoi's outbangle protects him or her from the backlash from invoking a colored card.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **characters with true names** (swefen) may invoke a colored card to make a white card. however, there is backlash of chaos when invoking a colored card. typical result of a swefen invoking a colored card is to have the swefen character sheet exchanged for the white card item, leaving the sentient with a magic item and no character to possess it.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **characters without a true name** (aquaestors) have no ability to transport colored cards, and they have no ability to to invoke a white card magic item from the colored card. the will and thought of such aquaestors is not sufficient.
