 My beloved is Three

 Three yet only oneâ€”

 Many things appear as three,

 Which are no more than one.

...various quotes sent in by a teacher, taken from science tests . . . My favorite:
"The skeleton is what is left after the insides have been taken out and the
outsides have been taken off. The purpose of the skeleton is something to
hitch meat to."
Nemesis thought that was funny. Ah, out of the mouths of babes...

 big bad nemesis

 parthenogenesis

 no one moves a muscle

 as the dead come home.
