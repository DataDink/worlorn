### grey card strange attractors

archetypical or purposeful magic

#### 

#### power
>
>  a **grey card** represents the ability make an item of certain power to prevail within one archetype or purpose. 
>
>  in the cycle of  [dance](dance.md) , **grey cards** make items from chaos. in the cycle of  [dreams](dreams.md) , **grey cards** made items from nothing: from the void, *ex nihilum*. in the cycle of  [history](history.md) , **grey cards** made items from memories. in the cycle of  [astronomy](astronomy.md) , **grey cards** made items from cosmic rays. in the cycle of  [comedy](comedy.md) , **grey cards** made items from various humors.

#### 

#### perfection
>
>  a **grey card** represents the ability to make items which competently-serve one archtype or purpose regardless of local conditions. manifest **grey card** attractors are therefore among the middle order of white cards.

#### 

#### consistency
>
>  **grey cards** make white card items (artifacts) which have guarantee of performance in all places and all timeframes. local conditions cannot disenfranchise a **grey card** artifact from its archtype or purpose. the white card manifestation of a **grey card** functions within its archetype or puropse *NO MATTER WHAT*. 
>
>  a **grey card** artifact function within its archtype or purpose regardless of local conditions and regardless of whims of the dominator. however, invoking the primary archetype or purpose of an artifact always alters local conditions *NO MATTER WHAT*.
>
>  during the invocation of the archtype or purpose of a **grey card** artifact, the whims of local dominators are immaterial and *do not prevail*, although local dominators of course may simultaneously respond within their own archetype. surviving dominators may react to **grey card** artifact invocation only in timeframes after the artifact invocation.

#### 

#### multiplicity
>
>  multiple white cards may not be generated from one **grey card**.
>
>  multiple **grey cards** may not exist representing one particular type of strange attractor. 

#### 

#### dismissal
>
>  a **grey card** wielder may dismiss its white card attractor (manifest artifact) in one round while crossing-in-the-mist occurs under the inspiration of a  [muses](muses.md) . this one-round invocation is required regardless of whether the **grey card** weilder is crossing-in-the-mist of worlorn, or without inspiration.
>
>  when not crossing-in-the-mists of worlorn, a **grey card** wielder may dismiss the manifestation of the strange attractor controlled by that **grey card** within the constraints of continuously forward moving time.
