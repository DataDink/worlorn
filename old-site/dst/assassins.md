# assassin guildfounders

dreaming grandfathers of assassins

### darolilm jedide

founded by grandfather summer
>
>  When he made 15th level, Remo killed not just the Grandmother of Assassins, but ALL the assassins from the previous guild. Rumour has it only a half-dozen of Remo’s friends survived the purge (Dira, Nasty Catstomper, Nathan Stack, Evingolis the White, and Roland, an ex-paladin of Troy Ounces turned holy assassin of the Mother of Knives), and these suviving students of Remo became the 14th level guildmasters of the new era.
>
>  Remo founded a Troad guild structure where guild brothers knew only five other guild brothers. Each assassin knew the identities of only four subordinates and reported to one overlord. This cell-based structure prevented anyone from guild-wide vulnerability. The Guild was called the Darolilm Jedide.
>
>  The darolilm jedide guild structure was rigid, but it did introduce honor and loyalty into a profession not known for these traits. Additionally, the darolilm jedide introduced assassin’s cloaks and guns into Troad, with the guns delivering the only "Death, no save" magic into Troad: the Homer, bringing the now famous line into useage: "you can’t get away from a Homer."
>
>  Remo’s day job was teaching fifteen elves a new class, "Dark Angel." A dark angel was an elvish monk-assassin, with a few extras. By this time Remo had slain the human Master of Summer (15ht level monk) and claimed the title "Grandfather Summer." Dark Angels immediately became nemesis to the normal monk hiearchy, but were seen as the elite members of the darolilm jedide guild.

### stormtrooper guild

founded by grandfather darth: death’s knight
>
>  Eventually one of Remo’s student’s, named Vannik, took Remo in a training exercise of some kind. This occurred by accident and well before Vannik was 15th level, but the rules didn’t have a time limit for ascention. Once having killed a Grandfather, Vannik was permanently entitled to fifteenth level ability once he achieved the proper dreaming experience for the title.
>
>  Although later failing some obscure Dark Angel ritual callled "Kharst," the ex-Dark Angel Vannik did eventually reach fifteenth level of dreaming. With the ’grandfather clause, Vannik started another assassin’s guild, separate from Remo’s Darolilm Jedide.
>
>  Vannik’s guild has a strong tie with the Church of Death (Yama Deathgod) where Vannik was Highest Priest. Remo never appeared to be bothered when Vannik established a Guild of "Stormtrooper" assassins.

### MARIO and SEVERIAN

>
>  Two of Remo’s sons were trained as Dark Angels. Mario and Severian each slew Vannik in order to achieve 15th level Grandfather abilities, but neither wished to form a lawful guild structure, and each is rumoured to have ressurrected Vannik after assassinating him. Some skeptics believe the ascention of the two sons of Remo is why Remo allowed himself to be slain by Vannik.
>
>  Since their sister  [morgan](morgan.md)  was the inventor of  [morganti](morganti.md) , Mario and Severian are both Morganti Weapon Holders. Both had peridot weapons and Morgan enchanted Severuian’s "Terminus Est" as Morganti #19 and Mario’s "Secret Weapon" as Morganti #20, according to legend. Also according to legend, Morgan was reluctant to give Morganti powers to EGO weapons that could easily overpower the bland personalities of her brothers. 

### JERICHO

the road warrior
>
>  An up-and-coming guildmember assassin named Jericho once slew a clone or nightmare of Remo called "Mewick" in d-state adventure in the capital city of the Trojan Empire. Jerichio is known as the Road Warrior, and kills people on the road by hit-and-run with a strange chariot called "the last of the v-8 interceptors" There is no more information on Jericho.
