 consulting the wisdom of the ancestors

> consult the wisdom of the Qu'al Mark [& Swan Mark] on the subject of 
> morganti weapons
Swan Mark common wisdom passes that the first er-per’henne Morganti Death
occurred at an Abelard Sanctuary atop a mountain within Swan/Wengen
Territory. Many Swan felt 'a disturbance in the force" and common wisdom
indicates between five and six hands of Swan Elfar immediately heard the
Call of Avranaith. The specific Wisdom of their calls was intentionally
withheld from their marks.
It is common wisdom passed on by the Swan that Castle Erorn in Swan
Territory is the lair of two Morganti weapon bearers, the Bounty Hunter
Michael Donn and his teyn the Coven Angel Padraig [see also third answer,
below].
Ryandall's Quaal Mark has absolutely no wisdom to pass on about Morganti
Weapons. Unlike Swan Elfar, Quaal Elfar deliberately hold the mark aside
when horrors are encountered, to prevent bad wisdom from tainting
ancestors. The practise of setting aside the Wisdom of the Quaal is known
well to the mark, but horrible wisdom itself is never passed on by Quaal
Elfar.
> weapons delivering the real death
The Quaal Mark passes on the wisdom that an ArchDruid of the Trees, the
Founder of Orion's Woods, wielded a black sword of the Real Death. It is
not known if the longsword was wengen steel or black mithril, but it is
known the blade was not part of Morganna's infamy. The name of Orion's
blasphemy is not part of the Wisdom of the Quaal Mark, but it is a lesson
to be passed on that Orion was denied circle rebirth by the Phoenix because
he carried such a weapon willingly. A branch of Quaal theology is concerned
about the Phoenix preventing the Motherlode from allowing a Master Druid to
be born again.
> and weapons made of living wood
Both marks pass on common wisdom that there are many weapons of living
wood, sufficient to indicate creation and enchantment of such items is not
the exclusive realm of druids. Wisdom passed on by both marks says living
wood is not limited to wood from the Tree of Life or the Tree of Knowledge,
although magical value departs wood from these trees when it is not
sustained as living wood. 
Wisdom passed on by the Lios Marks suggests initiation to most coven
circles demands a creature to create his or her own wooden knife of living
wood, called a thammay. Swan Mark confirms this for the Shando and Wengen
circles, and Quaal Mark knows this is true of of Sacremento Circle. Wisdom
indicates creating a coven thammay requires roughly a second level druid
spell.
> being most interested in intersections of the three.
Swan and Quaal Mark wisdom suggests that the "only" intersection of
Morganti, Real Death, and living wood was Kankyo, the Shando arrow. The
Swan Mark hints at another weapon without any specifics, but there is no
such wisdom in the Quaal Mark, despite common wisdom regarding Kannon as a
member of Sacremento Coven around the time of Orion's rise to Archdruid.
Padraig, the wielder of Kankyo, was kav elfar raised outside the holdfast,
who joined the Coven of Fleeter. He ruthlessly ascended to  Mastery of the
Ninth Circle in less than a hand of years. 
Not being circle born or even deepwoods, Padraig stole and abused all the
Circle knowledge he could obtain for his own powers and benefit, including
learning the secret of Shando arrows without pledging to that circle. 
When Padraig was exposed to the Logrus, the power in his bow and arrows
became sustained, so Padraig was able to use them for paid assassinations
without fearing them to become unclean in the Motherlode's eyes. When one
of Padraig's eleven arrows was selected to be a Morganti Weapon, Kanyo was
named. 
No Swan wisdom is passed about Padraig after the thirteenth year of
Necrodemus, when the Coven Angel slew a Dark Angel brother (along with the
spirit possessing him).
