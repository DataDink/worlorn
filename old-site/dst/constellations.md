# the night sky



Under the moon and the stars above, it was a perfect love

### Lighting for  [night](#night)  and  [day](#day) 



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) You and yours need to secure my consent to lay down character dice or I deny the guilty party  [constellations](constellations.md) . And conversely, if anything is in complete Dark I don't give a flying *@!#%. Got that folks?

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Either choose from the following constellations or your night sky will be what ever is showing in  [llewghund](llewghund.md) . I will work on the Llewghund chart when I have my dice and my  (mailto:deborah.gadzikowski@castelle.com)  in the same place at the same time."

 Most of these are Constellations some are single stars, some are oddities.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) There are several options for daytime lighting. 
 
#### Choice 1: you can state your choice or have what ever is shining over  [llewghund](llewghund.md) .



 
#### Choice 2: pick from this list:

 



* **7 white dwarves around a Red Giant**

 If you have this you have  [redlight](redlight.md)  every 11 hours for a one hour duration. 6-7 am 18-19 p.m.
* **A single Hot blue sun star**

 You'll want some clouds to defuse this cause it is rumored to drive folks crazy. On the up side, if this is your only source of daytime light you only get  [redlight](redlight.md)  when there is a Red Sun Spot (very rare!)
* **A Trio of a largish green star that dances with Twin blue & red stars**

 Infrequent but very predictable Red light, when the red star eclipses the other two.)
* **A single large orange sun star**

 Great sunsets with this one.  [redlight](redlight.md)  is more frequent than options 2 & 3 and less so than 1, but predictably always at sunrise or sunset. Sailors like this for predicting the weather. At most the dangerous  [redlight](redlight.md)  would last 3 turns.
* **A varying 6 sided sun or 6 suns Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.**

 Bounces through the sky rolling and changing form when it changes trajectory. Very Pretty!, delights small children. This option has the most frequent  [redlight](redlight.md) . Each bounce lasts 30 minutes and there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will be a  [redlight](redlight.md)  bounce.
* **Northern Lights**

 1d10 +1 shimmering, ribboning, glowing pieces of glorious Aurora. Caution! Northern Lights are addictive. Folks who have been around the parts that have this kind of lighting genuinely miss it when they are elsewhere, like a real heart ache. For a select sensitive few, missing the Northern Lights is an Artifact Longing. With Northern Lights as the daytime turf light, True  [redlight](redlight.md)  is very rare and gives you plenty of warning. It will start getting orangish then Pinkish then slowly fade to full red then Shimmer away. If you have proper protection it is absolutely stunning to watch.
