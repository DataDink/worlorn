  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the dry land is where you go when you die. the wathan, or immortal spirit travels to this place that is no place to forget enough to permit reincarnation as a new entity.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the dry land would appear to mortal eyes as a starlit plain with no artifical light. newly dead arrivals to the dry land pass the time in cities with buildings, and perform meaningless tasks resembling their life work until they forget such things. mortal eyes would see the major death servants assigned to protect the wathans of the dead, but the dead do not see. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  one end of the dry land is bordered by a low stone wall of forgetfullness. the other end of the dry land rises as mountains to reach the stars.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  yama’s avatars appear as dark-haired men, of no particular height and muscular build. his avatars are equipped exclusively in the colors of blood and iron. his most-known avatar wears a red turban and crimson cloak.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  when his avatars fight, they use double bladed axes of iron or throwing knives of bone. yama has been known to display the spellcasting of an archmage, the emptyhand combat of the master of autumn, the woodland stealth of a ranger lord, the righteousness of a paladin lord, and the weaponplay of a three-sword samurai. yama’s supernatural weapons include returning-throwing knives of elephant ivory, and a huge redsteel great axe. his red emerald reflects psionic attacks away frm his mind, and his cloak controls spell- and technological-energies directed towards him. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  yama is an artificer of some skill, known as one of the great smiths of worlorn. yama recognizes the archtype and can create or repair Attributes for any Aspect if he is able to study the Aspect without interference. he is familiar with 'technology' magic of the black rabbit, gorm, as well as the supernatural magic of traditional mythologies. yama’s background and instinct for tools allows him to understand the function of any weapon on sight. with a single minute of study and the proper amount of time with the proper tools, yama can make a duplicate of any man-made, dwarf-made, or elf-made artifact. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  legends claim yama dharma is the reincarnation of roger bacon and knock. it is known yama has ridden the dragon of compass mountain in knock, for yama and vlad drakulya divided the 1001  [dragonbones](dragonbones.md)  through out worlorn.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  yama has the power to be aware of, and may choose to accompany at an instant, any entities which are dreaming or dancing. yama is said not to exist in any place if ever time passes while no dreamers or dancers are active.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  yama dharma strikes dead any life which meets his angry glance. he sees as with true seeing, and knows the good and evil in beings visible to him.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  minor death servants collect the souls of the dearly departed and guide them over the wall into the dry land. once over the wall of forgetfullness and within the dry land, the spirit of the dead being loses all memory of its previous lives over a period of time. all memory is lost before a being is permitted to depart and become re-incarnated. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  because of their timid nature, deceased kimdissi are guided to the dry land by one of twelve special minor death servants provided by the deity Besgar Knightshade. these special minor death servants do not appear as “scary” to the recently deceased Wathan. upon death, any kimdissi, including hobbits, halflings, and voler, is guided to the Dry Land by a female kimdissi warrior, called a **Valkyrie**. much of what you think you know of the Valkyrie is true.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  to return the spirit to a deceased body, a priest/ess must cast a different spell depending on whether the wathan has reached the Dry Land or is in transit.  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  a priest/ess must invoke the miracle to *raise dead* in the first month after death in order to successfully summon the wathan of the recent dead back to the flesh of life; this is because a minor death requires a month to guide a wathan over the wall of forgetfullness. only the miracle of *ressurrection * pennetrates into the dry land to steal a wathan before it forgets its previous life. many a priest/ess has been disappointed with *failure* casting the miracle of ressurrection *before* the wathan reaches the dry land, or casting a raise dead *after* the wathan has crossed the wall. timing is a critical factor. no priest/ess may raise or ressurrect a *reincarnated* wathan.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **death’s looking glass** is a mirror of mental prowess or scrying mirror with divination ability. on command the looking glass displays the optical viewpoint of any being, living or dead. the undead have no viewpoint discernable by **death’s looking glass**. the wielder may command the mental viewpoint of a creature once per day or once per  [redlight](redlight.md) , whichever is more frequent to the observed creature’s timeline.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the device may not be transported or utilized by the intention of a Blood-law creature, including Silver Class billykins personalities. only a pure Dust affiliate may wield or move this device without dying instantly. upon contact of Blood-affiliated spell or flesh or device, the instigator of the activity finds itself without incarnation, wathan trapped in the glass of the mirror.

 
 **the high one** on death’s looking glass:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the **death’s looking glass** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *death* in worlorn, including but not limited to physical, spiritual, and mental mortality.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  undead entities, such as those without life but with incarnation, are explicitly outside of the domain of death’s looking glass, regardless of the  [muses](muses.md)  they serve, or servcice to Blood or Dust.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the khannish people are silent humans with a tendency towards obsession. they make excellent soldiers and excell as mages. when at war the khannish do not surrender, although they have the wisdom to retreat when circumstances make such demands.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  khannish markets are quiet places, and they do not discuss weighty matters at the dinner table. jewelry is not worn for decoration or beauty, but the protection of magical talismans is advantageous to a khannish socialite. weapons may be worn in any place of a khannish society but for the temple or the bedroom. khannish priests may draw blood outside of ritual sacrifice. the khannish are extremely succeptable to the effects of alcoholic beverages; many elfar wines are poisonous or fatal to the khannish constition.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the manchurian province of lartroxia is the main home of the khannish people in  [troad](troad.md) .

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  khannish women fight as fiercely as their men.
