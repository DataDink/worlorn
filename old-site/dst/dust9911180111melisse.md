# Dust in the Wind



 Hell's Fury

Melisse speaks out from the depths of Hell: 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  This act is foul. So much that even the Infernal Realm turns away from it, and you. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Let it be written down, so that it be not forgotten: You are denied the solace of Hell. The way is closed to you. You are forbidden entry. You are not allowed. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lead a GOOD life, Chrysofar, Last Defender of Troy. Lead a good life, for when the Final Judgement comes, if you are not found worthy of Heaven, there will be nowhere for you to go.
