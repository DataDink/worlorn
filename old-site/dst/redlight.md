# red light

no dusk, no dawn

Red Light falls at sunrise between rising of the first white dwarf sun and visibility of the red giant they surround. Red Light falls at sunset between the first white dwarf's contact with the horizon and the touch of the red giant's disk to the horizon. This occurs like clockwork, from 6-7 AM and 6-7 PM without variance for the season. 

 Red Light turns certain persons to small puddles of Blood. This has been proven for  [lightworld](lightworld.md) . If you are out of doors when Red Light Falls, the following creatures are turned to Blood: 

* Dust agents 
* Kin of Troy 
* Dust Law Characters with True Names 
* Dust Law clerics and paladins with or without True Names 
* Roke Archmages / Mages / Wizards / Sorcerers 
* Muad 'dib / Sozuo / Star / Ricercar / Marlee / etc. 
* Burgundy 
* Crogin 
* clones and simulacrums of the above 
* various others who have crossed Luces Rojo or his son, Jorie. 

 Don't say that Luces Rojo name out loud, any time, indoors or out, unless you're immune to all Blood Magic. 

### Protections from Red light:

 The following conditions protect creatures from Red Light. 

* wearing an earned Hissarlik outbangle (character w/outbangle MUST end crossing in the mist. in one of the Nostoi life hutches; 
* being indoors shrouded with Secrecy 
* being indoors at  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md)  
* being indoors at Diaspar 

 Historical evidence indicates that Red Light sends characters to  [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) . 
 If you believe your character is empowered to wield carded items, then you should know that ALL such charcters are turned to a pool of Blood (no saving throw) when Red Light falls directly on them. 

 Red Light now shines again in Worlorn. Threnody made a new flavor of Red Light, which is not the same ...wavelength... as Luces Rojo's or Tololuvin's. 

 Threnody's Red Light does NOT detect dust law name level dreamers who hide INDOORS during Red Light. This is a marked difference from Luces Rojo's Red Light. 

 Threnody's Red Light could have detected dreamers. Threnody intentionally did not have his Red Light seek dreamers via their dreams, but only via where the light falls directly.
