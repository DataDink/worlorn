 After the first onslaught of priests and paladins come on pilgrimage to the Chamber of the Pattern, the ruins of New Troia became a permanent habitation once more. Tents gave way to shelters, and soon there was formal agreement in the Church of Troy to rebuild the city in its previous image. Surviving elders in the church showed their true devotion with donations of time and resources. Organization and financing was placed under the controls of Her Holiness Auvvergne, the Theocrat of Diaspar, and there was no graft. 

 After the cleanup of dust and rubble from the site, the first teams of constuction workers assessed the foundations and found them solid enough. Materials were imported, with generous sorcerous assistance from afar by the Trojan Princes, as coordinated by the high priest Caine. Within days the Princes had transported sufficient amounts of raw Emerald, wood, and tools for the faithful to rebuild two cities. 

 The Hektrites claimed rights to police the inevitable disturbances, and the Eressenes set up day-care, counseling, and health facilities to ensure the workers would have promising experiences and perhaps stay to populate the new town they were building. Food caravans and other trade ventures for the builders assured New Troia would be on the trade routes by the time the city was complete. 

 There is much speculation who will rule in the city, and what it will be called. New New Troia is cumbersome; people call it New Troia or New Ilium.
