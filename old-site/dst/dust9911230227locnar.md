# dust in the wind

 your expensive handbag and those cheap shoes

```

who / will love this little sparrow?
"not i," said water
"not i," said hell
"not i," said sanctuary
"not i," said rules
"not i," said fire
"not i," said preservation
who / will love this little sparrow?
"i will," said the earth. / "from dust you were made and to dust you shall be."
now, how _did_ that song go?
ta,
- LOCNAR
remember 6.3.2
-MAKER OF RULES
