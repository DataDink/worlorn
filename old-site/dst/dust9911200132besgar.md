# dust in the wind



 observations

```
		
I'd like to make some observations.
1.)  Omnis Goodknight, I believe you are wrong about Red-light.  Red-light, 
when it turns a creature to blood, KILLs them.  They are then recreated, 
cloned, in Hissarlik.  These creatures are killed by red-light because 
someone perceives them to have acquired enough power to be a threat.  Those 
in power FEAR those who are coming into power, thus they are thrown in the 
dungeon.  
2.)  Bluelight, and now the wind itself, turns all inspired blood creatures 
to dust, KILLs them.  Except this one doesn't just kill name level creatures, 
it kills any creature inspired by the muse of dance.  
3.)  I have heard talk that each cycle lasts 4444 years.  If a creature 
survives 4444 years it becomes immortal.  I say a cycle is immortal...the 
muse of dreams is immortal....
4.)  We are playing a game.  There are those who want the world to end, Dust. 
 There are those who want the world to continue with the current rules, 
Blood.  Anyone find it strange that we go from dreams to dance and red-light 
and hissarlik still remain the same...wanting the status quo to continue? Not 
caring that the world has changed hands?  (Someone tell me if I am wrong on 
this one.)
5.)  I propose that there is a possibility of a third team.  A Neutral team.  
Beings who don't want the world destroyed, only parts of it changed.  Between 
law and chaos there is neutrality.  Between Good and Evil there is 
Neutrality.  What is there between Blood and Dust?  Is everyone saying 
"Nothing?" You are either here to destroy the world or maintain it as it is?  
Do the gods care if a creature is Blood or Dust? NO.  And I sort of think 
that Sludge is not the answer.
