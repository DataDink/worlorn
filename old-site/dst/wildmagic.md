# Wild Magic



goldcards and rokers and wild things

oh my.

### The Archtype

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) wild magic is limitless power within one archetype. there are two perfections in worlorn: the aspect and the attribute. both tend to be aided by wild magic, either planned or retroactive.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **aspect** is wild magic generated by a personal force, an anthropomorphic archetype, or an entity which perfectly displays a facet of reality when the mood hits it. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **attribute** is wild magic harnessed to an object. such an object can aid an imperfect will in attaining perfection. most aspects and attributes are wielded in a unified manner. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) see also roger zelazny's legends of *lord of light*.

### Compact and Wild Magics - Part I



* **5.15.1** Lato's Musekillers protect/attack vs Wild Magics invoked from the Book of the New Day, possibly also any tangible Wild Magic mentioned therein.
* **9.2.13** Gold Road intersects all Wild Magic with turf; i.e. Gold Road is congruent to all Wild Magics that mainifest  [dominions](dominions.md) .
* **10.8.20** The  [compact](compact.md)  says there are only 16 turfs where the Muse of Dreams grants experience points, and these are the turfs of Oimota's 16 Dominators..

### Compact and Wild Magics - Part II

 
#### Executive Summary

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) once crossing-in-the-mist resumes under the inspiration of a  [muses](muses.md) , certain individuals can invoke the  [compact](compact.md)  to get the power of multiple  [goldcard](goldcard.md)  Attributes.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) since guaranteed success requires only two gold cards to defeat one, this means entities who invoke Wild Magics under the Compact can kill/maim/pillage other entities, even Wild Magic wielders who are between adventures in their  [dominions](dominions.md) , with the likely exception of The Eight Major Archetypes.

 
 


#### Discussion

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) all it takes is a 2:1 Wild Magic ratio in favor of the attacker, and boom-you're-dead No Matter What. One Attribute nullifies the defender's Attribute, and the second Attribute wins unopposed. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  [highone](highone.md)  suggests that all Dominators review and prepare for the eventuality of Wild Magics appearing at irregular and unpredictable intervals once dreamers begin Crossing-in-the-mists. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) under  [oimota](oimota.md) , an entity may wield only one form of Wild Magic within one place-and-time. However, The Book of the New Day entitles certain entities to Wild Magics when they Cross-in-the-mist. This means that certain individuals can wield one tangible Wild Magic under Oimota, while wielding the power of WILD MAGIC granted under the Compact.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) these sources of WILD MAGIC are sponsored by the Compact of Dreams, and therefore guaranteed to certain individuals, even to the point where one entity could be controlling multiple Wild Magics against the will of or in combat with another entity.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the only people with a measure of safety are the Oimota's 16 Dominators named in the Compact. If any of the major archetypes or turfs are compromised, then the Compact is broken, which would leave unsupported any Wild Magics granted by the Compact, possibly before their attack is complete. The resulting scenario is left as a mind exercise for the reader.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  [klew](klew.md)  of  [hissarlik](hissarlik.md)  also appears to be safe from attack, apparently wielding all five rings. Ten separate Wild Magics must co-operate to defeat Klew in Hissarlik. Note also this means Klew on a whim may vaporize any two of us simultaneously, without regard to the Compact.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) be polite and watch your back, folks. don't piss off people and they won't come for you.

 
-The High One.
