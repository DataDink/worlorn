# elfhome

blessed are the peacemakers

 I am interested in establishing a sanctuary for dreamers and their companions at Elfhome. I would like to offer restorative/resurrection capacities, but my only ability is in wishes and psionic healing for which I must be present. I would like to set up a benevolent organization and would appreciate your assistance. If it would not be asking too much, perhaps you could use your ability to resurrect if I am unable, or if it would be more convenient than a wish(to whom I know not who the wishes currently appeal). Please let me know if you are interested in participating.

 Elfhome has a new popularity as sanctuary for those with elfar blood. The return of the founder of Elfhome has reduced the martial emphasis on the vilalge and transferred the focus back to the original sanctuary it started as. The non-holdfast Kav Elfar make best use if Elfhome as a hometown, for they have no other place since the fall of Castle Black into the Sea. 

 The Shanagate Holdfast kethi are notably enthusiastic about peopling Erin's Elfhome with non-aggressive Holdfast brotherhood. With their support, Elfhome remains a place for kethi to congregate, despite Irinjade Holdfast's withdrawal to a man. Every other holdfasts participate, even the little seen Kenn and Taal. The little-known ultra-conservative Taal Holdfast kethi (mark of the horse) sent a party for permanent residence, showing up one day riding their legendary spirit-horses. 

 The Khan sends Order of the Equestrian emissaries as soon as the word of Taal gets out. Appearance of the Taal could be a _large_ coup in Manchurian-Elfhome cooperation. No Khansman has seen a Taal spirit horse since The Great Timujin burned the forests of Fleeter, and the covens withdrew in protest.

 The Great Khan Tigris grants an audience to The Great Lord Erin, and is seen to be deeply moved by Erin's speech of friendship and brotherhood. He clasps Erin's arm and hand in friendship before he retires, an action which some say will create enemies for the Khan within his own court. 

 One advisor is heard to say "I trust him," and the Khan himself is heard muttering with disbelief in a drinking house that evening, "No wonder the Holdfasts call him "Betrayer." 

*** 
 The Taal, upon hearing the tale of Khan Tigris and Lord Erin immediately establish permanent quarters at Elfhome. Taal Holdfast Equestrian Riding School Inc. is established before Erin returns from Isuame, almost outside Elfhome city limits, where a human presence would not insult ANY kethi, even the Braith. 

 The Taal Holdfast teachers do things no man has seen before, leaping from horse to horse, making pyramids of kethi at the speeds of the wind. None sits a saddle when he rides. They offer to teach "any who come to study in the peace of Erin." Khannish samurai and other horsemen flock to the call. 

 "Erin's peace" becomes a common catch phrase heard often in Elfhome, less and less often with Irony.
