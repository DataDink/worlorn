>  Milo, the resident 'active' guildmaster for the Mime cult, suggested [a mime shooting a man with a toy gun] was actually due to **clowns** being dressed up like mimes. He pointed out to me that clowns use props, not mimes. (And furthermore, he boasted, mimes don't need weapons to seem impressive.)

>  There have been vague rumors of a psionicist mime, who makes illusions visible to all but himself. It makes his career as a mime difficult, if not impossible: very hard. He doesn't quite realize that he is suffering in this manner, making it doubly difficult. Vryce has not participated in any guild gatherings in the past year, and rumor has it that he will be forced to become a rogue mime soon, unless he can succeed in a proper miming.
