  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Dolbadarn is a placeless place of absolute peace and rest. It may be found by any being touching Ground who needs or desires sanctuary, though it is on no map. The Eressene Crusaders who make the place their training ground make all visitors welcome, tending to their hurts both physical and spiritual. Children in particular, abandoned or orphaned, are brought to Dolbadarn, where the Eressenes  [orphanage](orphanage.md) . The Head of the Eressene Order, Ellen Ripley, or Eressea's husband, Vlad Tollenkov, will greet all who desire an audience with Eressea.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Castle Dolbadarn overlooks the whole land, with the Watersea on one hand and the sea of primal Chaos on the other. The lands are gentle and fruitful, with meandering rivers, leading to badlands and rugged cliffs far on the horizon.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Dolbadarn upholds the Laws of the Courts of Chaos, and of the Kin of Troy. Dreamers supported by either the so-called "Blood" or "Dust" laws are also supported in Dolbadarn. Dolbadarn recognizes no ultimately superior Law to the will of Eressea, save for the Will of Troy.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) There is **no**  [redlight](redlight.md)  within Dolbadarn, at any time for any duration. Eressea, Named **Light of the World** by  [troy](troy.md) , needs no external Light source from New Worlorn.  [attribute](#attribute)  is the source of all light within Dolbadarn,

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **Eressea** is a daughter, a wife, a mother, a dreamer, a lover, a mourner, a protector, a granddaughter, a worshipper, a healer, a Paladin. It is said she slew her best friend and brought her worst enemy back from morganti death.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Eressea** appears as a young woman, supernaturally beautiful, with long, emerald green hair. Ageless and immortal, only her sad eyes betray her thousands of years. She dresses simply, in a long, flowing, brilliantly white gown. At her side hangs her topaz katana, Iss Hogai, the gift from her grandfather.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The **candle in the wind** is the focus of all external elements in Dolbadarn. Eressea holds the glass bowl containing the Water from her  [FIXME: adab](adab.md) , in which floats a small glass oil lamp whose Flame flickers in the Wind, which gently blows back Eressea's hair as she gazes out of the window in the tallest tower of the sturdy castle. The candle in the wind represents Eressea's contribution to  [highone](highone.md) 's new Worlorn. 
 **the high one** on the candle in the wind:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **candle in the wind** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *Protection* in Worlorn.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) It is said that the native population of Dolbadarn may be named after the mythical Duke of Aubec, who came to the castle on the edge of the sea of Chaos; for love of his Queen, with his own strengh of Will he pushed back the Chaos to order the lands on which the people now live.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Aubec people are happy and content, with little need for ambition. Those occasional few who desire more sometimes join the ranks of the Eressenes, or take passage on a Ship of the Sea to find their destiny in foreign lands, following the model of their mythical ancestor.
