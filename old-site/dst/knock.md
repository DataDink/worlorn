# Knock



 a Billykins deity

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Knock was the deity in the Billykins world of the same name. Knock, Llabyrinth, and Compass Mountain were various faces of the cube that was Knock's Dominion. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Knock was a Chaotic Good marble dragon deity for clerics. In Knock's world, worship was determined by the professionone followed as much as the morality and ethos of the worshipper. He could see six seconds into the future. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Once upon a time the mortal human named Roger Bacon was incarnated as an avatar of Knock.  [FIXME: ~guipago](~guipago.md)  and other Billykins deities also incarnated as Knock's *Iahklu* peers. Bactor became the Black Rabbit Gorm. The *er-perhenne* Chaotic Evil deity Al-bac was of course defeated by *Iahklu* ingenuity, and broken into  [dragonbones](dragonbones.md) . Somewhere we lost the patella, but that was eventually recovered. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Roger Bacon was eventually assimilated into  [yama](yama.md)  to fight yet another Billykins incarnation of Al-bac. Knock's divine nature was  [history](history.md)  by  [muses](muses.md)  to remain within  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  to fight as  [tiresias](tiresias.md)  against Al-bac's Worlorn incarnation, the Demonlord Tloluvin of  [redlight](redlight.md) .
