# upright man rules



honor among thieves

* be ready to give the wall.
* not to walk arm in arm as he owns the wall.
* when we meet a friend, take him aside.
* not to walk with a cane or stick under the arm.
* not to use the sauntering gate of an idle Spaniard.
* to be cautious of staring in the face of those that pass us by.
* passing in haste, let us make way with the elbows, not hands.
* not to fasten your eyes upon any who enter publik buildings.
* at eating houses not to be foward in our discourse to strangers.
* not to disregard others by humming or singing.
* never force French manners on Englishmen.
* in a coffee house never use the practice of using more than one paper in hand.
* in a pew in church go to the far end rather than clog the entrance.
