# voidcastle



home of terpsichore?

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Voidcastle is an emerald city with the same design as Diaspar, Ilium, Muili, New Troia, Rebma, and Troy. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is said to have been created by Vlad Drakulya Tepes, but others claim that his lifelong friend  [remo](remo.md)  created it. It is suggested that when Vlad annihilated Castle Drakulya while misusing a Slaver weapon, he found himself stranded in the  [void](void.md)  with Remo. Remo’s half-dragon intellect used a Major Arcana  [trump](trump.md)  card to form a city **ex nihilum**, out of the Void, around the lost pair. the Voidcastle city allowed the pair to recover from the mind-numbing vacancy of  [greyspace](greyspace.md) , so the lost pair was able to rest sufficiently until a way back to  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  could be found.

 Time Was one Nostoi, Roland, alone in his party, was able to withstand the Void on either side of the pathway beneath Voidcastle? I believe the Nostoi was accompanied by quite a few powerful non-Nostoi PCs who were going insane, such as Michael Donn and perhaps Hektor. Recall that even this Nosoti was not feeling too well. 


 This was one of the few adventures when iahklu survived a holiday at Voidcastle. Nostoi  [remo](remo.md)  Senethari is said to live in this same Voidcastle, wielding the talisman and core Power of the school of Sinanju, the Statue of the Muse of Dance, Terpsichore.
