  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **open road** is the current incarnation of the gold road. it goes everywhere and everywhen. if you have a map, you can get there from here.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The **gold road** appears as a two-lane road made of gold bricks. Some theorize that it is the pathways created by dreaming dragons as they flew through the air long ago, or even that  [openroad](openroad.md) . Others say "what are you, nuts?" Nobody knows the entire truth. It is generally an accepted travel method, especially over long distance and otherwise inaccessible areas. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) One can travel to any of the  [dominions](dominions.md)  and  [domains](domains.md)  merely by setting a destination as you enter the roadway and meeting such encounters as dictated by the **rules of travel**. The rules are set by Waldan X and adhered to, even to the detriment or benefit of travellers. Due to the nature of the road, travellers must encounter other travellers or denizens of the road due to the peculiar mechanics of high speed travel. If one did not take the encounters, disaster would result if travellers came together at the high speeds of road travel. One known way to **avoid encounters** is to travel with a road priest. Priests of Waldann high-Ironjade X can access the necessary magic to avoid an encounter, if it proves too hazardous. There are also other ways that are left to the traveller's resourcefullness. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Obviously, one should be prepared for any contigency when travelling the gold road. Fabulous wealth and agonizing death have both been found when travelling the road. There are also rest stops and eating places called **country kitchens** run by pellinese orcs to sustain the weary traveller. Travellers with sucking chest wounds, may find succor elsewhere so as not to spoil paying customers meals. All are welcome to use the road. Characters of lesser capability often choose otherwise.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The **magic bus** appears to be the seat of power. Many have travelled in it and few have left completely the same afterwards. Try it, each experience is different and guaranteed. As to what, we have no idea.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) a cooler between the front seats contains all the ice-cold schlitz® beer you can drink, but make certain to throw your empties out the window.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Waldan** appears as an elf of medium stature. Long white hair, shoulder length. Typically wears a light denimshirt and blue jeans. Does not appear to be anything special. Typically wears mirrored sunglasses. Appears to be fairly even-tempered, yet is flippant, in a mellow way. If one looks closely, there is a certain grace and strength around him. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) He is likable and quick to help others. He has helped dreamers and dancers alike. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) He is rumored to have developed sludge, the blood/dust mixture. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Has been associated with a number of personages of note. Rumored to be tayn of the archmage, Hal. He has also been sighted with Troy; there is a rumor of blood and the cup of Hermes. A number of legends revolve around this one though. The funny looking hat with the stain on it is rumored to be made from the skin of the Demonlord's dog. The source of the blood is unknown to most. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) He has accoutrements of fighting, wizardry, thieving and barding. He is never far from a guitar and a book and sword. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) He most often will be found driving the Magic Bus on the Gold Road. Most travellers of the road may meet this character. He has a number of magical works to his credit, The Orb of Sentient Dragon Control, being one of the greatest. It was once instrumental in the eternal Troad goal, "rescuing the kin of Troy". He is also rumored to have slain the Demonlord and "that other elf deity guy" more than once, and one legend has Waldann killing both at the same time. :P 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Enemies may find Waldan X to be a resourceful and dangerous opponent. Others may find him to be an ally of some power.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) If anything, Waldann typifies freedom. He will not make promises, but is a man of honor. The freedom to act, to travel, to not be bound to a master. Slavery is an abomination. The freedom to attain one's highest potential. Many have asked Waldann's help and gotten farther with a polite request than the promise of all the riches of the world. Free will and choice are utmost importance.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Favored people** include The seeker, the dreamer, the dancer. The people of any race, sex, occupation who attempt new knowledge and exploration. Dreamers and non-dreamer alike who ask for help have normally been granted help, even at expense to Waldann. These are favored people of the God of the Open Road.
