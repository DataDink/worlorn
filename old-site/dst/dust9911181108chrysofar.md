 sick of red light

Wasn't desparate. Just sick of Red Light and not being able to do anything
about it. So I did something about it. Unsubtle, maybe but hey. Got the
point across. So as soon as Red light goes....we'll tone down the Dust in
the Wind bit....
BTW any idea how many were sent to Hissarlik as a result of Red Light?
