  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  When he made 15th level,  [remo](remo.md)  killed not just the Grandmother of Assassins, but ALL the assassins from the previous guild. Rumour has it only a half-dozen of Remo’s friends survived the purge (Dira, Nasty Catstomper, Nathan Stack, Evingolis the White, and  [roland](roland.md) , an ex-paladin of Troy Ounces turned holy assassin of the Mother of Knives), and these suviving students of Remo became the 14th level guildmasters of the new era.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Remo founded a Troad guild structure where guild brothers knew only five other guild brothers. Each assassin knew the identities of only four subordinates and reported to one overlord. This cell-based structure prevented anyone from guild-wide vulnerability. The Guild was called the Darolilm Jedide.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The darolilm jedide guild structure was rigid, but it did introduce honor and loyalty into a profession not known for these traits. Additionally, the darolilm jedide introduced assassin’s cloaks and guns into  [troad](troad.md) , with the assassin gun delivering the only "Death, no save" magic of Troad: the **Homer**, bringing the now famous line into useage: "you can’t get away from a Homer."
