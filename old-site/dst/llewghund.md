>  llewghund consists of a castle of that name and surrounding lands, sometimes far-reaching. geography is uncertain due to the whims of almitra, but llewghund castle nearly always sits atop a cliff over an ocean.

>  on close inpection the castle appears to be a single piece of jet-black stone with blue veins. the ziggurrat is a separate piece of the same stone, and pre-dates the castle construction. the castle was formed *ex-nihilum* as a gift of lemurian gods when almitra's party assembled the heart of light on top of the ziggurrat, and the gods deemed their servants required a dwelling place.

My chaos is evidenced in every roll of the dice and every toss of a coin, as well as every lay of the cards, dripping of wax, drifting of smoke, swirling of tea leaves, swing or cycle of a pendulum or suspended RING, the mode of laughing, dots made at random on paper....

 No matter where i have sailed no matter what i have beheld i always feel

 most at home near the sea.

 Sea of Chaos is the mother of all seas, all shores, all everything.

 it is also the end. 

 it is everything

 it can give everything and take everything 
 three days ago i practiced creating flowers from Chaos

 they where perfect and so beautiful I gave them back to my beloved Sea 

 yesterday I made an Adelweiss, small and white clean and bright....

 It reminded me of my neighbor. So I pinched and bruised a leaf to give it a 

 pain and a need and I kissed it to give it a love, then I floated it in a

 glass bubble across Sea of Chaos to wash up on the shores of  [FIXME: dolbadarn](assets/dolbadarn.htmlh) .
