# hissarlik



"a place of fortresses," the hill on which troy was built

**Hissarlik** was the  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  of Roke Mage  [FIXME: helfelven](helfelven.md)  as a self-contained world with much of the order of the troad, sustained by the five elemental rings, themselves great works of another Roke Mage, Ged. 
 Hissarlik is a plane or collection of planes not easily reached from the prime material. Although Hissarlik is typically thought of as a dungeon, over half of the twenty 'levels' are actually outdoor environments. 


 The **Trial of Hissarlik** consists of aquiring twenty runes, one per level of Hissarlik. These Runes are incorporated into the  [akashik](akashik.md)  of a dreamer, With all twenty runes, a creature is ejected from Hissarlik, and the personality becomes an immutable archetype, called  [nostoi](nostoi.md) . 


 Dreamers of sufficient knowledge and powers may enter or leave Hissarlik without regard to the Trial of Hissarlik. However, Nostoi from Hissarlik may return only by relinquishing their immutable archetype. In  [troad](troad.md)  a name-level Dust Law dreamer is turned to Blood by exposure to  [redlight](redlight.md)  and permitted to awaken only within the Trial of Hissarlik.
