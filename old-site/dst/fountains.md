  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Fountains of Paradise overflow with Life. All life is precious. The Fountains stand at the center of my Turf, giving the water of Life to all portions of the turf. To the North is the Forest filled with all creatures of the forest. To the West is the Desert filled with all creatures of the desert. To the South is the Grassland filled with all creatures of the grasslands. To the East is the Ocean filled with all creatures of the ocean.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The weather of the Fountains is bright with the life giving sun during the day and lit by the moon at night.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Travalers are welcome to enjoy the wilderness surrounding the fountain, but must remember that all life is sacred in this Turf, Death dealt on this Turf to any good or neutral creature spells doom and banishment to the dealer of the death (banishment happens as soon as the blow is delt and the Master of this Turf gains empathic ability to trace this person down to meet out justice).

I grant the prayers asking for life to be given back to the Dead, I will intercede on the part of my faithful one tim ein four, and give them reincarnation. All others must pledge themselves to owe a boon to me to gain my favor, and even after the pledge then I will grant reincarnation to one being in ten.
