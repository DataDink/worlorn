>  ***Entry conditions***
 **The ONLY Way**

 travellers to Musquel-in-the-Abyss may only enter one person at a time, no matter what. A queue is maintained during high-immigration scenarios. Violation of entry conditions results in forcible ejection of immigrants to Skagganaut Abyss or the Open Road. Thank you for your cooperation.

 **The view from the Open Road**

 Musquel-in-the-Abyss can be reached using the Open Road. Upon arriving at Musquel, travellers may notice that the The Road continues away in either direction into an inky oppressive blackness that seems to take one's breath away. travellers of poor fortitude may find themselves retching from vertigo and/or wheezing at poor air. The hardier may tolerate the environment better. When a group of travellers arrives, all but the one entering must remain on the Road (entering single file), activate the Road, or step off into the Abyss. 

 From the Road you can see an opening into a small square room, approximately three times as tall as it is wide and deep. The two side walls are frosted and translucent, with black cross frames in both the upper and lower halves. In the opening, a frosted translucent door, hinged at the center and on the right, rests folded halfway open. This opening is just large enough for one creature to step through at a time, no matter what. 

 There is a small grey box at shoulder height on the far wall of the room that cannot be reached without entering the room. A conical depression just above center faces the door. A thick grey string leads out from the box to a small conical cup that rests on a peg attached to the left side of the box. A rectangular drawer with a bar handle is positioned at shin height below the gray box. 

 **The view from Skagganaut Abyss**

 The path to Musquel-in-the-Abyss appears as an aberration of the Abyss. It can be perceived with any sense if you are able to perceive. It can be reached if you are able to travel. The Abyss has not established a reputation as a medium for travel or perception.
