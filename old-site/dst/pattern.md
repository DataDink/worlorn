# troy's pattern



a historical perspective on defunct technology

 * Threnody, about patterns needing to be made with mortal Troy-blood? Define mortal Troy blood....like the god himself can't do it? * 


 Exactly: the god cannot make a new pattern. It was Dworkin's plan that no God could have power over shadow, so he made certain that it was only Troy blood, in mortal form, which could bring order from the domains of Troy. 


 This means that Oberon, if he still exists, could never bring back his own Troad pattern without mortal Troy assistance. 


 The Pattern of Troad was made with the blood of Dworkin (one nickname for the pre-god mortal human Troy-who-conceived-Troad; Threnody has _lots_ of names for the various Troys). Then god-Troy (Oberon) ratified EVERYTHING about Troad, including the liabilities: like end-game conditions and like the no-gods-can-use-the-Pattern Rule, and like mind flayers being Kin-bane. What a collossal fuckup that Oberon was: ratifying it all! What a bozo.
