# vision of flambeau



 throne away

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [sharra](sharra.md)  grabbed Derrick’s left hand in her right and held the torch close to Derrick’s face with her left. She whispered the word, " [flambeau](flambeau.md) ." For a moment it appeared that she moved the fire into his face, but then the brightness was gone, and Derrick was unburnt. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, the room had changed. Instead of a the tree house under the stars, the two stood indoors within a torch lit room. The walls were spherical, unpolished metallic grey, but brightly lit by torches like the one Sharra was placing into a freestanding black wrought iron sconce. The floor, too, was circular now instead of a square, a wooden platform only fifteen feet across, giving the effect of an airy moat between the wood and the spherical walls. A walkway extended from a single door to the platform where the pair stood alone. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra whispered, " ’Ware the walls of cold iron." and pointed to the doorway. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The single door was guarded by two drow warriors, helmless, but otherwise in traditional drow blacks: midnight cloaks, Galvorn mail, greaves, and boots. They came to attention immediately, drawing longswords and peering at Sharra and Derrick. Immediately, one nodded to Sharra, and both lowered their weapons. However, neither guard sheathed their blade, preferring instead to point them to the floor behind their heels, partially hidden in their cloaks. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra strode down the walkway to the guards without acknowledging them. Derrick caught up with her as they passed the guards. The door was wide enough for the two to walk abreast between the drow, and they did. Derrick noticed the iron door had a wheel in place of a knocker, on both sides. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  As he crossed the threshold, Derrick was inundated with thick smells of sulfur and incense. However, no smoke was visible. The corridor outside extended straight, as far as Derrick’s eye could see. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The corridor was wider than the door, perhaps the diameter of the iron sphere, thirty feet wide. The walls were grey stone, and the smooth floor was black, perhaps blocks of polished obsidian polished like glass. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Also as far as the eye could see, the torch lit corridor was occupied by guards, adult drow men and women. They had tables and cots, clothes racks, wardrobes, and dressers, center aisle as open as the walls were cluttered, as if an army was bunkered here with all its gear. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The corridors were eerily silent. None of the drow spoke out loud, of course, and the sounds of their movements were muffled. Other than the soft sounds of chanting in the distance, there was sound from the occupants of the endless hall. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Twenty steps past the guards, Sharra glanced sideways at Derrick and stopped. She placed her hand behind his neck and pulled his head close. She leaned so her forehead touched Derrick’s, and whispered, "While I live, my consort would not be threatened. A companion might be challenged." She suddenly strode away. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  After a moment, Derrick contented himself to follow a step behind when he caught up. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Thirty steps past the guards, and every thirty steps beyond, the corridor was reinforced by dark wooden beams, a square foot in cross section, held aloft by pillars of similar wood. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Two torches in floor sconces stood beneath each beam. As they approached, Derrick noticed that the beams and pillars were carved with designs: warriors in battle, people slaying dragons, sailors on ships at sea. The wood was carved from left to right, starting at the base of the left pillar; all were at various stages of completion. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "The stories of eight thousand warriors carved in Weir Wood," Sharra breathed quietly over her shoulder. "Conscious here between mortal incarnations. Forty one miles of barracks between foyer and throne room." Derrick met her eyes, and Sharra smiled. "We won’t walk the whole way." she assured. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Words aside, Derrick followed Sharra, striding past dozens of beams. Walking past beam after beam, Derrick saw that the drow occupants had arranged the corridor into private areas with the beams as boundaries. Their gear looked well cared for, much of it opulent, although some well-worn items appeared to have cherished places. Most areas appeared unoccupied, but well kept. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No one read, or sat still, or meditated in silence. Every drow present, man or woman, was working at something: none appeared bored. Some practised weapons alone or with a neighbor. Some had tables set for alchemistic experiments, some had altars for singsong, prayer or chanting rituals. The religious icon appeared to be a bird, rising from a large fire. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Some drow worked the stone, carving doorways into the stone walls between beams. Perhaps one room in five had no gear in the hall, but instead revealed only a doorway in one or both walls. All completed doorways had cloth or beadwork hanging over them, some with multiple layers. "Death Shrouds," breathed Sharra, catching the direction of Derrick’s glance. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Some drow carved at their beams overhead. "Lest they forget their previous lives," whispered Sharra. "They would be ashamed not to know their stories when judged by their goddess." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  After walking perhaps an hour, Sharra stopped and lifted a torch from a floor sconce. Nearby drow looked over with curiosity, but no malice, and none stopped her work. Sharra grasped Derrick’s right hand and again seemed to shove the torch in his face momentarily, despite a warding gesture. This time Derrick heard no word from Sharra. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Looking about, Derrick saw the hallway was exactly the same, but differently populated. Sharra kept the torch in hand, but released Derrick’s fingers. Sharra walked to a vacant section of hallway, stood before a doorway covered by many layers of silver lace. She closed her eyes, held the torch out to Derrick. When he took it from her, she said "stay," and ducked behind the curtain. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Derrick looked about. The neighborhood was filled with only women, all kneeling, all chanting in front of simple altars constructed of expensive materials. The pillars to one side and the beams overhead were entirely covered with carvings, and Derrick saw all the unfinished pillars had designs from the ceiling to within a foot of the floor. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Derrick looked to the pillars on the left and right of Sharra’s door. He stepped to the right. The most recent carving was only an inch from the floor. Derrick’s finger traced the figure of a woman with hair the length Sharra’s had been, carrying a body from what appeared to be a bald-headed man with tentacles for a beard: a mind flayer. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  He stood abruptly when Sharra appeared. She bore a staff of wood, the same hue as the beams and pillars, capped with the black Galvorn metal on each end, inset with fire opals and carved with designs in the same style as the pillar Derrick stood nearest. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra’s eyes travelled from Derrick’s face to the base of the near pillar, and back. She turned away, whispering, "keep it lit." She strode, faster than before, up the hallway. Derrick had to run a few steps to catch her. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  As they passed beneath the beams, Derrick noticed the number of praying women dwindling. At the same time, above and to both sides the wood become entirely covered with designs. Presently there was no empty space at the base of the pillars. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Soon after, Derrick saw some two-foot tall three-limbed carpenters with huge eyes replacing the carved beams with fresh wood, displaying no carvings at all. The delicate creatures chattered quietly amongst themselves, but not loud enough for Derrick to recognize any words. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Serioli," said Sharra, startling Derrick with the volume of her normal speaking voice. "Moties. E.T. phone home. They are the best artificers in all the worlds. Serioli race has been slaves their entire existence." Over her shoulder, Derrick saw Sharra smile faintly. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Apparently the Serioli were stone masons as well as carpenters, for a minute later Derrick passed some of the creatures tearing down curtains. They were sealing off rooms with mortar and cut blocks of the wall’s material. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Within ten minutes of leaving Sharra’s room, Derrick and she had walked to the end of the hall. Here the portal contained doors of wood bound in iron, with iron knockers instead of wheels. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Here the portal was guarded by a score of male drow warriors with spears and short swords at the ready, none of whom appeared to recognize Sharra. There were three priestesses on each side of the door, each with her Galvorn armor bearing the symbol of a red bird rising from flames. Those on the left also decorated their armaments with rubies, and those on the right were decorated with fire opals. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  One male soldier from each side of the door stepped forward and made the hand sign for "Halt." Sharra stopped and clapped her staff against the obsidian floor, unexpectedly making quite a few cringe from the sound. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra regarded not the soldiers before her, but the women near the doors. She lifted her empty hand, and froze monetarily. Simultaneously, a priestess on each side spoke sharply in an unholy tongue most lawful and evil, and a complete and deafening silence descended on the corridor. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra signaled with the hand over her head. "I have the right to audience with the Queen given to me personally by the Greater Prince of Evil Drow Devils himself." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "The Prince is no more," signed the priestess on the left, confidently. "His will is moot." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Her peer across the hall waited until the first had finished before signing, "You may pass, Sharra, the Decameron." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Another priestess on the right side signed, "Your Wathan is known to us regardless of your face this life, beloved sister." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The third priestess on the right side signed, almost before the second had finished, "Be welcome, Mistress of Fire." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Nodding to each other across the hall, all six priestesses take off their black gloves. Derrick barely has a chance to notice their scarred hands before the six women grasp the iron door knockers. However, Derrick can plainly see the women scowl and grimace as they pull the heavy doors open. He notes that all six fall to their knees after the doors swing wide, and how the soldiers come to their aid, spreading healing salves over inflamed palms. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra had paused to allow Derrick to enter immediately behind her. Entering the room, Derrick became aware that his Githzerai companion followed visibly behind him. Derrick noted his Gith appeared to be equipped as only a mirror of Derrick once more: nothing extra, nothing missing. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The room within was huge, a cave without end, a massive open hall. From his vantage at the entrance, about thirty feet above floor at the top of an obsidian stair, Derrick could barely see the distant throne at the room’s center, and the far walls were lost in the smoky haze. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The din was almost as thick as the smoke. There was much singing and laughter. There were drow people, eldren and drider, gathered about countless fire pits of coal. Various things were being cooked above the pits, and the cavernous expanse overhead filled with all the smoke that wasn’t in the hallway. The room held none of the order or serenity of the hallway. It was as if all the restraint of the hall was shorn from the drow who entered the throne room. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra put her hands on the rail of the stair and stood, surveying the room. She called over her shoulder, "In this place at this time, this room, I won’t be able to represent your friend. I presume there’s a chance he can fend for himself." Derrick looked at the gith, who shrugged, but drew a poisoned blade from its sheath. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra of the Flames stepped down the stairwell without a glance backwards to her companions. Derrick followed, with his gith a step behind. Derrick counted seventeen steps before placing his foot on the black glass of the floor. With the last step, Derrick descended into an army of drow warriors and priestesses as far as his eye could see. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Even before descending, Sharra had engaged the attention of the nearby crowds. Three warrior women at the nearest firepit approached Sharra warily, and stood ten feet from the stairwell bottom. The three wore fire opals on the hilts of their drawn swords. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance existed that Derrick saw Sharra hand-sign to them "I remember you," as he heard Sharra say "I am Decameron." One woman smiled, one woman spit at Sharra’s feet, and one turned away without a comment. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The smiling woman signed, "We hope you have a life left to return to your people." A chance existed that Derrick saw Sharra sign a negation. "A last timer," said the woman out loud, with wonder. The spitting woman laughed, and held her hand high to sign, "I patiently wait for our illness to pass." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra strode past her and the other. Derrick followed un accosted, but the gith was bodily grasped in both hands by the spitting woman. She began to speak out, in the unholy language of law and evil. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, a chance existed that Sharra noticed the altercation. A chance existed that she spat a tiny flame directly at the woman’s face. A chance existed that the drow woman would not be resistant to Sharra’s fire. A chance existed that the woman would be blinded, and a chance existed that she would run directly into the nearby fire pit in her agony. A chance existed that the burning woman’s companions calmly returned to their discussions by the firepit. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra glared at the gith. "I fight my own battles," she said. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The gith looked up and replied clearly, in Khannish, "No, you were fighting mine." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance existed that there would be no other significant events as Sharra and Derrick made their way to be recognized by the drow woman on the throne. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The dais under the throne was three concentric slabs of the same grey stone comprising the corridor. Each of the three layers was a foot high, a stack made of thirty, forty, and fifty foot squares. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The throne was an immense iron chair, suitable for a small giant, inlaid with all colors and sizes of precious stones. Some previous tenant had made pale leather seat cushions that were designed to assist an elven-sized person to sit without sliding about, supporting her back without picking her feet off the dais, and armrests made so an elf’s delicate skin might not have to touch the cold iron arms of the throne. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra approached the dais. About sixty feet away, she sought out and presented herself to a priest with the burning bird on his armor. Without exchanging words or sign, the drow poked her finger with his quill, and wrote Sharra’s name on a scroll: Decameron: Sharra of the Flames. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Almost immediately, the Priest turned away from Sharra and pointed to a drow female warrior, crossing the stranger’s name off the list with a line of Sharra’s blood. A chance existed that Derrick calculated the spacing at twenty names per foot of the scroll, which put Sharra sixty to seventy names down from the last crossed off name. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  For the rest of the visit, Derrick did not notice anyone else approach the priest to add his or her name to the list, yet for his entire visit, there was an unending stream of supplicants to the throne. As Derrick and Sharra waited for an audience, the dais remained empty save for the throne and its occupant. The supplicant was allowed to approach only to the second tier. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance did not exist for Derrick to get a clear view of the Queen until Sharra approached the throne. Until that time, Sharra took Derrick aside to an otherwise abandoned fire pit and coached Derrick about the protocols for the court of the Greater Prince of Evil Drow Devils. Sharra appeared uncertain about only when she mentioned that the Queen on the throne was a reincarnation, not the Greater Prince. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Approaching behind Sharra, Derrick mimicked her every gesture, kneeling when she did, rising, all the while apparently keeping his eyes on the stone dais as she did. When Sharra knelt the final time, Derrick approached until he stood behind her left foot, and gazed down towards the floor. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance existed for Derrick to hold a piece of metal as mirror to view the Queen surreptitiously. Although it appeared that the Queen was looking right at Derrick, he studied her without turning away. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Queen Threnody was a youth, perhaps in her first fifty years, certainly having seen less than a century. Her short-cropped hair was barely on the yellow side of strawberry blonde. Although seated, the queen was probably 5’ 6” tall and 116 pounds, just like every other drow he had seen since coming to the court. Leaning away, lazing against the back of her throne, legs played out in front, the Drow Queen reminded Derrick of a phrase: "long slim legs, reaching all the way down to the floor..." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Queen Threnody wore only black, and alone of all drow in the room, wore no armor. Her billowing cloak was hemmed using black leather with silver studs, and trailed unpractically from the foot of her throne to end on the obsidian floor, some fifty feet away. Beneath her unclasped cloak she wore a lace camisole, a web of spaghetti straps from collarbone to midriff. A huge diamond covered each nipple, and the minimal strings otherwise revealed more of her pale breasts than they concealed. The Queen’s low hipped leggings had a slit up each leg, inside and out, flowing up from ankle until they disappeared under a mini skirt that was almost a belt. The Queen’s relaxed posture revealed to Derrick a codpiece of sequins or diamonds glittering in the firelight. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Her other jewelry was entirely silver and platinum, save for a moonstone set in gold piercing, her right ear lobe. The queen wore a ring on each of her delicate toes, otherwise her ivory feet were bare. A fine linked chain graced her left ankle. She wore what looked like platinum manacles on each wrist. She had a ring on each finger and each pale toe. Other than metal and black, the only color she wore was hanging off a silver neck chain: a pale green triangle dangling between her breasts. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The pendant matched her jade eyes. They appeared to watch Derrick as he assessed her. Derrick kept his moving. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Queen had weapons at hand. Unlike the spears, shortswords, and longswords favored by her people, the queen’s weapons were a well-used wakizashi and katana set, sheathed in black lacquered scabbards, and resting in a lacquered stand on her left arm rest. She leaned a 6 foot two-handed tachi against her left shoulder, held loosely in her left hand like a staff. Unlike those of the smaller two swords, this scabbard was covered in the same pale leather of the throne armrests and seat cushions. Derrick could read blue lettering on the scabbard, legible despite reversal in his mirror: MOM. There was a heart drawn around the word in the same blue ink. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Meeting his eye once again, the Queen cleared her throat and began speaking in Khannish. Derrick’s eyes flitted to the grey stone of the dais, losing the Queen’s reflection in his metal mirror. No chance existed for Derrick to regain his composure and view the Queen during this audience. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We recognize our Decameron." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Thank you my Queen." When Sharra replies in Khannish a great many miracles were cast in the unholy tongue of law and evil, and a bit of quiet murmuring arose among those who cast no miracles. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "State your Wishes." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Queen, I have need of a Master Control Device in the possession of the Hellen." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We have known of Hermione’s Collection. Your Wish to avenge yourself against the Illithids is nearly as widely known." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Queen, I Wish not to possess the wand for Illithids and mind flayers. I Wish for another device. I have become aware that a crown exists for the ogre races. I wish to take it from this place and put it in the possession of a . . . some companions." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Decameron, you are ever bold. Why fore shall we grant thee thy Wishes when thou chooseth to remain heretic and outside the fold for your last story?" Much muttering arose amongst those priestesses who were following the Queen’s words. She continued without pause. "If we were to recognize you in your current incarnation, might not our people think of us that our fires do not burn as brightly? If we are incarnated differently, it is because we choose it so. We think you also have made a choice. Would you prefer to wear your current flesh?" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Derrick heard Sharra’s intake of breath. The pause grew, longer, almost too long for the Queen to ignore. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Queen," said Sharra. "You know I serve you in all ways. Have you not told me how this body pleased you--" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Enough!" the Queen interrupted. From the throne there was the sound of clothing being arranged, and jewelry clicking on stone. "We shall discuss only the pleasure of my current incarnation." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "What pleases you most, my Queen?" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "It pleases us to have you attend my court while we entertain your question." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Thank you my queen." said Sharra. "I could Wish for nothing less." She rose to her feet and retreated backwards from the throne. She moved so slowly that Derrick was easily able to maintain his distance. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra continued to retreat until the next supplicant, a drow male, moved forward. When he began to sign to the Queen, Sharra turned away from the dais, and Derrick noticed her lips, tightly pressed together. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The two humans returned to the firepit. A chance existed that friendly members of the fire opal clan had left food and drink sufficient for Derrick, and Sharra to be nourished for the seventy four hours until Sharra was summoned before the throne again. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  During the hours they waited, no chance existed for others to speak with them, and no chance existed for either Derrick or Sharra to seek the company of others. At the seventy-fourth hour, the priest came for Sharra, and led her to the dais. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We recognize Decameron." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Thank you my Queen." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We are lead to believe your motivations for possessing the Master Control device may not coincide with the interests of my Dark Children." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "I have never acted against the Dark Children, my Queen." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "The Decameron might act outside the direct interests of our people without acting ’against’ our people." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "What pleases you most, my Queen?" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We are most pleased when our people act like our people. Decameron, you do no longer act like a Dark Childe." The queen paused. "What say you, Decameron? Are you yet a Dark Childe?" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Queen . . . I can say . . . I have nothing to say." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We think you have grown soft on the surface." There was a sound of clothing being adjusted on the throne. "We think that you discard all your lifetimes of Childean wisdom. You have grown human in one short lifetime." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Qu--" Sharra broke off her words as a golden crown rolled before her, and fell flat within arms reach. It was a simple gold cylinder, with no jeweled ornamentation. Derrick could count seventeen peaks about its circumference. Sharra reached out and grasped the crown. A black bag dropped to the floor near where the crown had been. Sharra picked up the bag and immediately set the crown inside. She pulled the drawstrings tight and tied the bag shut. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We think your tenth tale has a sad ending, Decameron. We do not wish to hear tell of it." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "My Queen. You . . . you shall hear of me no more." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We dismiss this Decameron, this Sharra of the Flames, and grant leave for her two companions to depart with her." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra backed away from the throne much as she had before. Sharra said nothing to Derrick on her path from the throne, nothing as they departed the chamber, and still nothing as they walked down the wide deserted corridor. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  At her room. again she commanded him to "Stay," but comparing word against word, Derrick this time heard less of command and more of habit. Sharra’s second visit was longer than her first, but on leaving, displayed nothing extra, no longer carried her staff. Aside from the bag with the crown in it, Sharra appeared to have nothing she didn’t have as she came to this place. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Upon exiting the room, Sharra knelt at the unfinished inch of wood and drew a bone handled knife from her belt. She knelt and lifted the knife above her head as if to stab the pillar, but then lowered the blade to hold it in both hands. The tableau held a moment before she returned the knife to her sheath. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance existed for Derrick to hear what she said then: "I am NOT finished." She wiped her eyes with her fingertips, rose and glared at Derrick. "Enough!" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance existed for Derrick to ask a question. "How many?" he said, sweeping his arm from pillar to pillar, encompassing the beam overhead. "How long?" 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "All of them. Over four thousand years." Sharra now saw, not the inch, but the rest. "My Wathan is nearly Ancient, just six years short of a full cycle. Four thousand, four hundred and thirty eight years. This is my last . . . I was a candidate." Derrick watched her face turn from despair to anger. "I AM a candidate." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  He smelled wood smoke a bare instant before he saw the pillar blacken and char as from a disease within. Before a full second had passed, the wood was engulfed in flame, both pillars plus the beam overhead. The intense heat was so sudden that Derrick heard the wood crack, left, right, and overhead. The beam collapsed. Instantly there was no air to breathe that wasn’t superheated by fire. Derrick lifted his hand to shield his face from the flames, and felt Sharra grasp his shoulder and give him a push. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A moment later cool air washed over his skin, into his lungs. Derrick stood with Sharra at Noni’s tree in Berrilyn, with the whole group staring on, as if their trip through the flames had happened in an instant.
