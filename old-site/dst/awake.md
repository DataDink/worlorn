# chrysofar, awake!

tanngrisnir's lament

```
Chrysofar, Awake!
The world is empty without you.
The blood of Troy's children burns
and our works are lost to black smoke.
Homeless, we wander in the night,
seeking refuge in the unfriendly waste.
Enemies fortify their homes against us.
The last refuge of the Pattern is Destroyed.
Oberon sings no more
For twoscore years his last sanctuary burns.
As my rage for his killer.
Chrysofar awake!
Old comrades have placed the firelord on high;
Flambeau's Fountains of Paradise are now Made Turf!
Former friends and enemies dream of glory
they plot again, and walk the earth against us.
One chance lost before you wake;
There is but one more!
Chrysofar awake!
I am tired of sleeping, and
My world is empty without you.
