 Ellen Rippley, the Matriarch of the Eressene order, reports:
>
>   “One evening a fortnight ago with the seventh hour just begun, a well-preserved faerie man came to the Sturdy Castle as if from the air or Moonbeams. He was weeping and smiling, so at first the sisters who know of the faerie expected some trick was about to befall us all, and they smiled and looked within for strength.
>
>  “But then, hear me, this Faerie, although he refused to speak, did no harm. Weeping all the while, he permitted us to heal him of the Faerie sickness, the kin curse, the Plague of withering. He seemed amused, but aided the sisters to preserve his life. When asked about his tears he would only shake his head and shut his eyes, and tremble from his grief. We could not inflict such pain, so they stopped asking. The sisters cured the blisters from his feet and the hunger from his belly, but we could only put a pillow beneath his head. Sleep did not stop his tears, but in fact freed his voice to cry out loud.
>
>   “Forgive me mother, for saying the name, but the faerie man cried for ‘*Isis* [to] *preserve* [him],’ and ‘*oh my friend*,’ and I am told once he said, ‘*what is the pleasure if the sacrifice costs our most vast potential*?’ The faerie man slept only that once in the fortnight he has been among us.
>
>   “From the next morning this faerie man followed the sisters and brothers of the order from shrine to shrine within the lands of Dolbadarn, for a fortnight helping them preserve the Eressene way among the people of Dolbadarn. He continued to hold silence even when one of the brothers noticed the Faerie man held a staff which would not burn or break under duress. Then one of the brothers noticed the clasp on his robes, and they brought him to me. he did not resist, but he clearly was not pleased.
>
>   “Good Mother, I saw him and I knew his staff, his clasp, and his robes from my own pathways of healing. We have a mage of  [roke](roke.md)  among us, weeping. I made as if to touch him, and he withdrew from me, revealing an amulet like unto my own, but serving another **Power**. Grey Lord preserve us, but I might have used the Stone against the will of its sister's weilder!
>
>   “Mother, he opened his mouth and spoke your name as if he did not expect you to be here, or even alive. I told him Troy’s power has preserved you and Dolbadarn through all the tribulations, and this Faerie man, he smiled through his tears, and wiped his eyes, and asked me to take me to you.
>
>   “Also he asked me if you had ‘**preserved his sword for him throughout these empty years**.’ Do you know what he means, what horrible sword could make a faerie man weep so to be without it?”

#### Subject: Visitor to Damon Maker's Court
>
>  An exquisite magic item comes visiting Damon Maker under it's own power. This thing appears to be a merging of an Elf's simulacrum and an artifact of PRESERVATION, being an artifact of such power the only thing Damon Maker can compare it to is Threnody's Star of Fire. This must be a Star of Preservation.
>
>   It is Proected against being wielded, by the Heart of the Earth artifact, as well as the Burial of the Dead artifact. Looks like the simulacrum has done well to keep itself preserved from foolish possession from others. This simulacrum appears to be halfway to making itself a real elf. It will have to de-protect the Star of Preservation before it becomes a real elf, or it will lose the Star. The Simulacrum appears to have this all under control. It's a fascinating creation, apparently self-made...
>
>   It speaks when it has finally achieved Damon Maker's presence:
>
>   "It is my purpose to inform you so that with knowledge you may work with Eressea to assist the Deathgod. I have told only her of this event. I now return to the Paths to preserve them from harm.
