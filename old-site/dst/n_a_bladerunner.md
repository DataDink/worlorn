 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  When Necrodemus I outlawed magical replicants of empire citizens, an organization formed to take active measures to rid the population of hominoculi, simulacrums, and clones ... for a fee, of course. Necrodemus didn’t expect anyone to do his will without suitable motivation. Named after their special weapon that detected and slew unnatural life, the Bladerunners were often seen chasing replicants through the streets of Necrodemian cities. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  One mage named Tyrell resented this and formed a business of making “Nexus” replicants of various percentages of the original’s knowledge, an enterprise that made him rich and has kept the Bladerunners in business for over five decades.
