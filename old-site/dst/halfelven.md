# the half-elven one

the only genune troy

**the half-elven one** is a clone of dworkin's flesh, sampled years before he became oberon. the half-elven one was awoken by iahklu in the troad after oberon's apotheosis, and saw his dreams had come true at another's whim. the half-elven one felt his birthright and creative muse were 'stolen' by his linear incarnations, and became righteously angered. if you have not read john varley's *the phantom of kansas*, you should. the half elven-one created a self-sustaining domain called hissarlik, but fled worlorn system for lemuria. 
#### tanngrisnir on the half-elven one

 Poor mortal. You saw how the Half-elven one withdrew and became irrational when he found that he could never compete against his own self, deified. 
 I'm forced to believe I'd do EXACTLY THE SAME THING in identical circumstances. Fortunately, Oberon is a crippled deity now, so I'm able to distain him him as I would any other god and follow my own path without seeing him arriving before me every time I invent something. 

 I will not resign and run away as the Half-elven One did, but instead rule... 

#### autobiography

 i came, i saw i conquered. when i came again, i saw that i had conquered, and went away rather than fight myself. 
 when dreamers had destroyed my world, i came back to conquer the void again, but instead i find chaos. 

 fun, fun, fun!
