# garfield land



 a most wretched collection of scum and villany

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **Dateline 79 Necrodemus** - With the death of King Garfield followed by sudden disappearance of Lord Dolarhyde and Queen Sander, eleven Heirs of Garfield have survived sibling rivalry to rise from a group of contenders, to a Council of Regents. They meet on a room with a big table to determine the affairs of the Garfieldland Kingdom. They tend to agree on only one thing; they are the rulers because they are the offspring of Garfield. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Rumors abound that there will be a combat to the death, one survivor. However, so far the event is not scheduled. The eight Sons of Garfield and three daughters appear to be content to rule as a group for the near future. Some say they prefer to assassinate as many contenders as possible before a up-front battle melee to determine the true successor to Garfield.
