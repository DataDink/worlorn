##### **The Tale of Faella**

 





 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I was born in a world without a chance. Three of the seven remaining turfs fielded armies of mind flayers. The  [yama](yama.md)  drove forth his Khansmen from the Paths of the Dead, cooperating in all ways with the Florentines fielded by his son, the Grey Lord, out of the District of Columbia. The Traveller's Nightmare aided their armies with free passage throughout the Wastelands with his  [goldroad](goldroad.md) . These three Dominators had been among the first to implant Illithid skulls. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It was the end of the Cycle of  [dreams](dreams.md) , and no one was Inspired to believe there would be a Cycle to follow. Crossing-in-the-Mists offered Inspiration to no *Iahklu*, to no *er-per’henne*. The  [troad](troad.md)  had fallen to Odysseus' black deed, and the  [halfelven](halfelven.md)  had fallen to the Illithids of  [troad](troad.md) . Terpsichore, the  [muses](muses.md)  of  [dance](dance.md) , had succumbed Fuzzy Pink, pinqued by the Warlord Marlee. No one thought  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  had any hope. People only sought to survive as long as possible before all creatures were enslaved for breeding food. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No one could Cross-in-the-Mist freely without a chance to meet soldiers from a mind flayer army. The Khansmen slew with great two-handed battle axes of Redsteel. Florentines shredded their prey with twin rapiers of the same deadly metal. Every Kav Elfar seemed to be from the Redsteel holdfast, wielding longswords and honor weapons mined from their mountain. Their mind flayer probability control guaranteed deadly accuracy, and maximal wounds. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Travel between the turfs was dangerous and fraught with disaster. Wilderness encounters were invariably deadly. The  [goldroad](goldroad.md)  was oddly preferred, for probability control does not determine encounters on the  [goldroad](goldroad.md) . This is not to say that the road travel was any safer than before the Traveller implanted his Illithid skull. Road travel simply did not allow mind flayers to guarantee encounters. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Near this time,  [morgan](morgan.md)  la Faye and the Phoenix had created Novus Mundi, in which those consumed by Illithids could appear to  [dreams](dreams.md)  again.  [morgan](morgan.md)  had cleverly created a mechanism to allow skulls to project memories of singular entities consumed by each Jade Skull. The Phoenix caused these projected memories to be reborn in flesh and blood of their true Inspiration. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I'm sorry to say Crimson, but the memories of Illithids never become true beings, were never able to walk a  [pattern](pattern.md)  for restoration. Projected memories like you were never able to cast shadows of their own. From all of  [morgan](morgan.md) ’s memories, from all of  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md) ’s notes, we had discovered no way to restore an Illithid projection to full Inspiration, nor had we found how to force an Illithid Skull to project an *er-per’henne* memory. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  We studied these memories to ascertain what the mind flayers had learned from our fallen comrades. As they explored Novus Mundi, we watched them reveal their skills, allowing us to better predict the next jaded army strategies. Some few of the skulls revealed the personalities of those who Implanted the skull, which allowed a greater window into the enemy's tactical ability. We explored the skull-projected beings, but our research ended abruptly when Severian brought the Real Death to Novus Mundi. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  In a rage,  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md)  ap Owen threw  [morgan](morgan.md)  la Faye into the Sea of Chaos. What may have been  [asteroid](asteroid.md) ’s only hope was ended in the heat of a moment.  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md)  bore  [morgan](morgan.md)  over my balcony and into the waves of chaos when he learned Severian had entered into Novus Mundi wielding Terminus Est, and had used the blade to end a life. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  In my time,  [morgan](morgan.md)  was never more than a mercurial vision, seen but not believed: a momentary dragon form, or woman’s face in the waves below my window in  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Although I've never forgiven the Phoenix, I believe  [morgan](morgan.md) ’s fate was better than  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md) 's. It is said that eventually the Phoenix rose from the Sea of Chaos, but for all the hours I sought his form in the waves, I was not there to impose law and order within him. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The  [yama](yama.md)  was waiting. The  [yama](yama.md)  Implanted a jade skull as soon as the Phoenix rose from the waves, and thus formed  [threnody](threnody.md)  on the sturdy rocks of  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  We immediately began to try to awaken a secret Nightmare of  [llewellyn](llewellyn.md) , but the *Iahklu* refused to Cross-in-the-Mist. From that moment, when  [asteroid](asteroid.md) ’s  [yama](yama.md)  and Phoenix were both Illithid, the Mortal Coil was no longer. No chance existed for resurrection, a path for reincarnation, or re-Inspiration. All deaths became the Real Death. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The only blessing in the dark times was that implanted Illithid skulls were non-cooperative with other skulls, armies, and true Illithids. None of the armies were willing to cooperate and perfectly Dominate one of the four remaining Turfs, or even perfectly dominate a wasteland. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Only  [hermione](hermione.md)  seemed to realize the Illithids perfected a probability with Turf cooperation. It was unproven, but known that  [hermione](hermione.md)  Inspired mind flayers with the corrupt  [muses](muses.md)  of  [dance](dance.md)  created by Vlad Drakulya's Nightmare. Evidence suggested that the Khansmen and Florentines and Redsteel were able to gain Inspiration, and thus their soldiers increased their chances to prevail in a given situation. Armies grew in power and numbers from all three Illithid-dominated turfs. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Among our studies of Novus Mundi we learned that projected memories could be used by Illithids as undetectable familiars to do their bidding. We set Salt Peter to guard the gate to Novus Mundi with The Fire Sermon. When Maeglin defeated him, stole the Weapon of the Wasteland, and slew the Buddha, we had no recourse to prevent jaded ones from collecting the projected memories from Novus Mundi and releasing them as spies. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Despite the Protections of  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) , in my time the family Trump displayed only dangerous places and jaded kinfolk. The locations depicted by Trump cards were invariably patrolled by Illithids, Kav Elfar, Florentines, and Khannish. And the personalities? The  [yama](yama.md)  took special pleasure in overseeing the devouring of all depicted Trojan family and friends, one by one. The  [yama](yama.md)  then raised the uninspired flesh as members of his own army, as if implanted with Illithid skulls like his own. Like a snowball rolling downhill, the numbers of the fallen only increased. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Although the devoured Kin didn't implant jade skulls to become mind flayers, we called them jaded. This was a description of their attitudes rather than for the color of their bones. Whenever there was a chance for conversation to demoralize us, the jaded Kin would tell us how resistance was futile. Even our morale was taken from us where the chance existed. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It seemed they were speaking the truth. There seemed no resistance that worked. When I met you, I had just slain my fiance. He had been observed Crossing-in-the-Mist by a jaded Kin. A jaded Kin of Troy artist had subsequently depicted him on a new Trump from memory. This was not uncommon; it was particularly onerous to kill loved ones who had become turncoats, but if jaded Kin were not pursued and slain, a chance existed that they would draw new Trump from their strongest memories. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Mind flayers devoured the Inspiration of each cousin pictured on the cards, until not one remained Inspired, save the few unreachable Grand Uncles and Great Aunts on the Major Arcana. Of course, retribution from the Patriarch was swift and invariably deadly, but Oberon’s single-minded revenge for any Trump-enabled death intimately lead to His demise by ambush. The year before I was born, Oberon Himself fell to the  [yama](yama.md)  Illithid. Trojan divine intervention was no longer known in  [asteroid](asteroid.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  My mother raised me by the sword, so I could always defend myself, even when magic has a chance to fail. My father exposed me to the light of Shal Omnis, the Queen of All Dragons, when I was but five years old. At the time father was afraid of creating a Jefty, but my mother assured him that exposure to an Orb of Dragon kind presented no dangers such as presented by the defunct Trojan  [pattern](pattern.md) . I remember their argument, if not the words, for it was one of their only disagreements expressed before me. They foolishly asked my opinion, as if a child of five could ever turn down the chance to play with a pretty new toy held before her. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  My father then wielded the Orb of Gold Dragons. Today as I close my eyes I can see it as it was then: a huge ivory ball covered in gold inlay, bigger than my head, bigger than the world. Of course, it was bigger then to my five year-old eyes than I know it as an adult. The gold dragons twined and moved under my father’s hands when he touched it, and he held it before his daughter whenever the spoiled little girl asked him to. I was his only child. He showed me his Orb, and then the ivory behind its metal facade. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  My life that followed pointed me like an arrow to fight your crusade. I became the greatest living archive on Trojan Powers, and a Dragon lord also. Before I was ten, my father had introduced me to the beautiful golden creature he had Mastered by body and spirit alone, and one day before my seventeenth birthday it deigned to speak to me. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Although the seven  [pattern](pattern.md) s of Dworkin were all ... ruined, I learned what I could of the Trojan family magic. My mother taught me to read using the lost texts of Brandon Corey, in which the Renegade depicts the trials and tribulations of creating Kin from replicants, of creating the first Minor Arcana, of creating magic to affect any manner of Trump contact, and creating one’s self anew by walking the  [pattern](pattern.md) . The day after my seventeenth birthday I found Fiona's addendum, and realized I already suspected everything she had written. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No living woman with so little true experience had ever contained such knowledge and power. I became liaison between the dying Trojan Empire and the infantile Church of Shal Omnis. Although Uninitiated, I have expertise in the Order and Law imposed by Dworkin’s  [pattern](pattern.md) . Serving Shal Omnis, I have the power of good dragons to call upon to aid any noble quest. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Eventually, to my dismay, I found myself leading the armies of Churches in fact if not in name. The Eressenes, the Hektorites, the Goodknights all petitioned my advice on their private issues, a habit I found most counter productive to the fight, although profound in the morale of my people. My time suddenly was no longer mine to spend wielding Lansing in the field, but became my people’s time, ratifying rulings with Kuroth’s Quill in my sturdy tower. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  When I stepped from  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md)  to the Wasteland for the first time in a year, I recall Mason joking that the mind flayers had arranged for me to be out of action. In your times, my aided perspective now wonders how much of his joke was truth. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  During my year as Matriarch, My Soren had been ambushed, devoured, and jaded, then returned to us in stealth. This Soren spy had reported a valid reason patrol in the Enigmatic Forest, and his data supported the team he deemed most likely to succeed: Soren of  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) , Mason de Lacey, and myself. Soren waited until nightfall of the full moon, and ... ambushed us on patrol. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, Soren had never believed that Lansing was consecrated in the Blood of Shal Omnis, and able to prevail against all odds. Although he and the Princess of the Moon could not change probability for my weapon, Soren’s own probability could be manipulated, and my ... reactions could easily have been predicted. If it hadn't been for the Princess of the Moon, my skill and strong blade would have disarmed him instead of stabbed his heart. A moonbeam blinded him at the fatal instant. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You Elves of Starlight were the bait for the trap of the implanted Princess of the Moon. I suppose she wanted to subtract me and my Lansing, a sword forged of Githyanki metal and powdered Illithid Skull, wanted us subtracted from her Shadow sufficiently to sacrifice Soren. During my year as Matriarch, in front of all  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) , I had summoned her by name and demonstrated no fear within my Sanctuary. She could not have been pleased. She let you be seen sufficiently to tempt me out of the clearing, out of my time and into yours for a chance to save Soren. Once stranded, she would never let me back. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I wonder if she considered it would make a Reece of me in your time. Yes, presumably I have the foreknowledge to allow your world to prevail against becoming the world of my birth. I wonder who is the John Connor to my Kyle Reece? Perhaps it is your Shadow's Simon Almustafa. Mine was Destroyed walking the last  [pattern](pattern.md)  by the Illithid Firelord  [threnody](threnody.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I hope a chance existed that Mason made it back to  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) , or at least to Fort Alexandria. He had the grievous duty to report that the Matriarch had been lost, returning with only her dead fiance in his arms. While this was certainly news sufficient to decrease morale by nineteen to twenty-one percent, I have never predicted the impact to morale if we three disappeared without any word back to our church. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Even still, I grieve for the world for which I fight never to see again. My faith carries me forward, against all odds, to enforce a new cycle in which Shal Omnis restores the glory of Troy, together prevailing against the Illithids and mind flayers that ended my world. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Whatever the cost, we must not let  [asteroid](asteroid.md) ’s peoples be enslaved by mind flayers. We need to place a Trojan Kin Inspired by  [dance](dance.md)  on the Throne of  [asteroid](asteroid.md) , one Initiated to the  [pattern](pattern.md)  of Dworkin. Vlad Petros is unworthy. Crimson Grey is sadly unqualified. Simon Almustafa must compleat the  [pattern](pattern.md)  or we shall begin anew the Dark Age I was born to.
