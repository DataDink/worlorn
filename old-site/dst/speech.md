Subject: stuff from Eressea
> Some are afraid that Eressea's appearance means battle for end of the world is
> at hand, but all are religiously loyal and most would follow her even if it's
> true. They are healers not warriors. The youngest, those who haven't yet
> earned a warhorse/skates, are eager to have Eressea lead them to heal forces
> of good at Ragnarok. The older Eressenes are wary of change but not hostile.
I assemble all the Eressenes, and stand before them in full battle array:
armor, Galahad Shield, Iss Hogai and Tol Eressea. I sense their confusion
and excitement. Beginning from simple calm assurance, I subtly change my
body language over a few minutes to the rigid bearing of a Paladin preparing
for War, so that it even shows in my eyes. Then suddenly, I boldly draw forth
Iss Hogai and shout "For Life!" I stand rigid, the Sword held high. I let
them experience their fear or zeal or confusion. Then I slowly lower the
Sword, and return to my original calm, assured stance.
"There is no Ragnarok."
"Or even if there is, it doesn't matter. _Life_ is not a battle to be won;
to even think of it that way guarantees eventual defeat. _I_ have thought
that way. Did you know? I was wrong. Once I restored to life everyone
killed in a war across an entire continent. They immediately turned back to
the slaughter. We are healers, but we must be healers of both bodies and
souls. Those who come to us seeking eternal life out of fear of death are
more wounded in spirit than in whatever bodily ailment brought them. Life is
not the same as not dying. Life is _living_."
I pause. Then I remove the armor and lay the shield aside reverently. I
remove all my weapons and lay them with the armor and shield, though I keep
the unsheathed Iss Hogai. I move to a pair (man and woman) of young Eressenes
and speak to them personally, though in a way so all the rest feel included.
"You know the stories. You know the power of Iss Hogai. But I tell you
truly: there is more power of Life here," laying my hands above their
genitals, "and here," laying my hands above their hearts, "than in any
holy artifact or relic. This morning I stood at the grave of a woman slain
by a Morganti weapon. It would destroy Iss Hogai forever to even attempt to
resurrect her; perhaps it would succeed. Should I do it? But how many
hundreds have been slain thus? In a war, Death is the only victor."
"But look." I lead them to a mother and newborn child. "See here the power
of Life to create and the power of Love to strengthen. Here is where death
is shown to be the lesser power. A life filled with Love is never wasted, no
matter how tragic its end. A life without love is a tragedy, no matter how
long." Recalling my son's conception and birth, my voice betrays emotion.
I indicate the armor, shield and weapons. "These have their place for you.
Defend life, yes. Remove the instruments of death as lies within your
capacity. But make life worth living. Befriend the lonely; calm the angry;
comfort the sad; teach children joy; reunite estranged families; find love."
I'll spend time with them, getting to know them better as people. If there
are doubts, fears or concerns, I'll work to understand them. I'll share in
organized rituals and impromptu get-togethers. I want every individual to
be motivated in the direction that best complements their abilities and
desires, and best heals their fears and works within their limitations. The
leaders are not forgotton; effective leadership and guidance are critical
skills needed by the Eressene organization.
