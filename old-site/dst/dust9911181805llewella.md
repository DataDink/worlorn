Let it be known that Watersea assents and cooperates with the Fountains of Paradise.
The archetype of WATER and REBIRTH shall be combined to give rebirth to all creatures
turned to DUST by the foulness of WIND. 
Furthermore, let it be known that Watersea assents and cooperates with the Fountains
of Paradise to assail the minions of the beast from Crosswinds. The archetype of
WATER and REBIRTH shall be combined to Drown and withhold rebirth to all creatures
from Crosswinds. Let no creature of Crosswinds drink of water to prolong its life,
but rather die for the lack of it evermore.
Let it be so.
Princess Llewellya of Watersea
