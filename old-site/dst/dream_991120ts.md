# a prescient dream

 one probable outcome
>
>   Tanri sees  [sharra](sharra.md)  just returned to Port Suame after saving  [maja](maja.md)  and Derrick from  [dustinthewind](dustinthewind.md) . She had used some  [roke](roke.md)  power to depart Port Suame with Maja and Derrick until some ultra-dude "Turfholder" named  [tanngrisnir](tanngrisnir.md)  "stilled the air" so there was "no Wind on the  [troad](troad.md) ." Sharra brought back Derrick's sleeping form and had just withdrawn with it and Maja into the Womb Room, an  [abelard](abelard.md) , when Muriel, the Dark Child houseguest from  [flambeau](flambeau.md) , came in and chatted them up.

>   It came to pass that Muriel said the name of the  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) , which summoned DUST in the WIND into the Womb Room. surely as if it was an invited vampire. 
>
>   No chance existed that Maja could survive DUST while trapped in the Womb Room. Maja's last act was to set down the cosmic dice for Sharra and Derrick. A chance existed that Sharra could live unscathed through DUST due to Roke Training. With Maja's help, Sharra survived. A chance existed that *For Derrick* could interpose himself between the DUST effect and the Sleeping Derrick. Derrick Survived. *For Derric*k did not.

>   Muriel was apparently entirely unaffected by DUST in the WIND. 
>
>   The (ex-)Phoenix ( [threnody](threnody.md) ) immediately ordered his servant Muriel give rebirth to Maja, another deity's minion who Threnody's minion had slain. Muriel was ordered to deliver four flags (Place of Power chocolates, coincidentally a power granted by the Phoenix) to the Highest Priestess of Brilliance, because Maja had been **Dusted** in her father's legacy Place of Power and therefore lost her inheritance until she inherited the other POP from her mother. 
>
>   When she sees the Flags as chocolates, Tanri is suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of  [dream_990621](dream_990621.md) . How Oddâ€”deja vu during supernatural prescience? Anyway... 
>
>   The Greater Princess of Evil Drow Devils immediately offered many gifts to the Goddess of Sunlight to appease Her for the damage done by an evil drow devil. Maja was reborn. In Port Suame instead of the Dung Pits. Maja was reborn with no constitution point loss, without losing reincarnations. Maja was given the chance to resume a Place of Power before her inheritance. Maja is immune to DUST in the WIND. 
>
>   Rebuking Muriel, her sword no longer talks, but rather instead now the sword burns piles of Dust with the **Fires of Life**, causing Dust piles to be reborn in flame as the human beings they used to be. If this is punishment, Maja thinks she wants to be punished by the god of Rebirth.... *not really. A joke, she insists. A joke!* 
>
>   Lord Morin was disturbed that Muriel and Threnody were unmoved by *For Derrick*'s sacrifice enough to give rebirth to the fallen Githzerai. However, Morin persisted and Muriel eventually gave rebirth to For Derrick. 
>
>   Sharra advised Maja to save the chocolate Flags of Power until she could assimilate them in a greater or enhanced manner of some kind, something about accumulating more power before Maja locked her powers in place, but Maja ate all four chocolate "Flags" right away and restored her Place of Power status quo nearly as fast as she could, because  [tanrisong01](tanrisong01.md) .
