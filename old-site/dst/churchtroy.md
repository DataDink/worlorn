# the church of troy



a religion of order and reflection

 The Church of Troy is officially "uncomfortable with Eressea's crusade." There MUST be repraisals coming from the Church of _Evil_ Drow Devils to this heinous act of heresy against their priests and members, but none have been known to occur in the year since the first Evil Drow Devil was restored to life, Lawful Good. The Church of Troy issues an edict that recommends Eressenes shun fire when possible, and all Trojans (faerie, wengen, kin) are urged to work no magical fires, lest the retribution be Destruction of the Trojan races. 


 Caine says this prohibition against Fires must include Fires in Dolbadarn. The Master of Flambeau Turf can probably Roke-Destroy anyone he can detect by fires in any turf where Fire is permitted, just as Eressea can Roke-swollow anyone in any turf who stands on the Ground. Caine doesn't like to think about Turf Wars; he's not equipped to counsel a paladin in that area. 


 Caine says the last time this happened was when Waldann high-Ironjade X converted ONE (1) damn cleric of Correlian Larethian. Jihad genocide continued between Kavs and Grey Elves until Waldann Morganti'd Corellian Larethian. Notice how many grey elves exist now, compared to Kav Elfar.
