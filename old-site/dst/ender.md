 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Ender Wiggen came to Worlorn. There exist wise folk who allege that Ender was an incarnation of the Weirmoniken personality that is known variously as Ged/Sozuo (Nightmares), Ricercar, and the Starmage “Star.” 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Some say Ender founded the  [n_stealthmaster](n_stealthmaster.md)  Battle School, but  [xcalis](xcalis.md)  claims Ender was merely the first notable Elite Teacher. Ender is known to have implemented the policy of teaching only human children at Battle School. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is known that Ender defeated the Elfar during the  [roland](roland.md)  Regency Rebellion, when  [erin](erin.md)  raised an army of Dralaar, Kavalaar, Phoenician, and woodland elfar to enslave the non-elfar races. Ender prevailed by overseeing his twenty Stealthmasters to command the three thousand human Necrodemian soldiers, decisively crushing the elfar forces that outnumbered his 8-to-1 at the battle of Rosewater. Ender retreated back to the Battle School when Severian Necrodemus III morganti’d Necrodemus II, and acknowledged the Regency Rebellion only by granting kav elfar kethi the legal right to bear holdfast blades as honor weapons. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The battle school graduated only a handful of Stealthmaster classes before Ender was morganti’d along with all the students in residence. Ender’s surviving stealth master Elite include Marlee “V” and Alai, each of which have been accused of the black deed. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Elite Marlee re-opened Ender’s school with an unprecedented class size of 64 children. The Elite Alai also is known to have continued teaching Ender’s strategies and tactics in a new Battle School founded elsewhere, perhaps  [voidcastle](voidcastle.md) . No other student of Ender has made a name under that credential. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Since  [endersgame](endersgame.md)  was recognized after Ender’s morganti death, many learned folk continue to debate whether another personality was using Ender’s legacy, or whether the boy-genius himself was abandoning his past, save for risking this one last obscure gesture.
