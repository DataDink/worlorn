My dearest Tarakian,
I had been enjoying our pleasant little conversation from a few
months ago, and it has saddened me to see how you have been so
viciously attacked recently by so many whom one would have supposed
were your friends. Some of us do understand and appreciate you, and
I in particular have greatly enjoyed observing the recent
choreography. (Not since the first days of Hissarlik has there been
such a wonderful lab environment for studying the complexities of
Child Psychology.)
The recent play has been so delightful, my brothers H. and N. have
been inspired to compose a jaunty tune, which it pleases me to share
with you:
  Today I am 
  A small green thing 
  Like a marble 
  Or an eye 
  With my knees against my mouth 
  I am perfectly round 
  I am watching you 
  I am cold against your skin 
  You are perfectly reflected 
  I am lost inside your pocket 
  I am lost against 
  Your fingers 
  I am falling down the stairs 
  I am skipping on the sidewalk 
  I am thrown against the sky 
  I am raining down in pieces 
  I am scattering like light 
  Scattering like light 
  Scattering like light 
  Today I am 
  A small green thing 
  Made of china 
  Made of glass 
  I am cool and smooth and curious 
  I never blink 
  I am turning in your hand 
  Turning in your hand 
  Small green thing
Renfrew

```
