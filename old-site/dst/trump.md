#### Trump of Wasteland

 Trump are magical artifacts for communication and transportation of Trojan entities. Trump often appear to be as large fortune-telling cards, usually three inches by six, constructed of ivory, and rarely other materials. Kin of Troy pictured on the  [trumplist](trumplist.md)  are known to keep their decks in boxes with their symbol on the case. However, into  [dance](dance.md) , the Trump appear more frequently as pocket mirrors that Reflect images when held at certain angles. 
 Benevolent Kin have created a  [trumplist](trumplist.md)  that includes descriptions as well as indicators of who is available and who is not. However, it should be known that  [eressea](eressea.md)  maintains the definitive master list of valid Trump. She is known to be generous to people who come to  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md)  in need of Trump decks, even non-kin. 


 Trump have been useful since  [patternfall](patternfall.md)  for exchange only between domains domains of  [goldcard](goldcard.md)  known to their creator  [dworkin](dworkin.md) :  [openroad](openroad.md) ; Gold Bowl/Buddha;  [fountainhead](fountainhead.md) ;  [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) ;  [flambeau](flambeau.md) ;  [fountains](fountains.md) . 


 Rib's Nightmare Gold Attributes automatically support only Greensheet Attractor  [trumplist](trumplist.md)  decks from the Courts of Chaos. 


 







 
#### Fiona on Trump

 *Fri, 27 Feb 2004 13:44:57; Garret says via Trump* 

> Uh, thanks Fiona - are these Shadow Trump, Hell Trump, or is Family Trump something different entirely?

 Fiona replies: 
Those names describe a deck of Trump of Troy by its  [domains](domains.md) . Various Archetypes Dominate or empower a given deck, determined by  [FIXME: aspect](aspect.md)  local conditions at the wielder's location. Whenever Dominating Archetype **A > 0**, then Trump are empowered to Reflect distant images. 


##### Family Trump

 
Family Trump are enforced and empowered by  [pattern](pattern.md) / [oberon](oberon.md) / [FIXME: aspect](aspect.md) . Family Trump operate in all Shadows of the Pattern of Troy with effectiveness decreasing as wielder and/or Reflection approach  [llewghund](llewghund.md) . 



*  [compact](compact.md)  ratifies Family Trump operation even against the will of the  [domains](domains.md) . 



* It is known that  [kolwynia](kolwynia.md) / [tiresias](tiresias.md)  ratifies Family Trump operation across Time. 
##### Shadow Trump

 
Shadow Trump are enforced and empowered by  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md)  [eressea](eressea.md) /Ground> and perfectly operate as expected in any Shadow of the Pattern of Troy when the wielder and the Reflection touch the Ground. 





* The Compact ratifies Shadow Trump operation even against the will of the 16 Dominators. 



* The Trojan Pattern ratifies Shadow Trump operation even against the Compact. 



* I believe that  [kolwynia](kolwynia.md) / [tiresias](tiresias.md)  ratifies Shadow Trump operation across Time. 
##### Hell Trump

 
Hell Trump are enforced and empowered by  [hell](hell.md) / [llyr](llyr.md) / [FIXME: aspect](aspect.md) . Hell Trump are the only Trump that perfectly operate as expected in Hell and Heaven. There is no Ground in Hell, and both Heaven and Hell are without the Pattern and normal Time. It is likely  [melisse](melisse.md)  or her Wrath can befuddle Hell Trump, but Dylan hasn't confirmed this. 





* The Compact ratifies Hell Trump operation even against the will of the 16 Dominators.

####   [threnody](threnody.md)  on Trump

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  * Is there a way to scan who is calling you on a Trump, or can I develop a spell to that effect for mine? * 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No known spell IDs Trumpers, but a Psionic Mind Bar can help block contact entirely, as can a Serten's Spell Immunity (lvl 8 mu spell). Mind Bar can even tell you when contact starts and what direction the Trump contact comes from, if you're high enough level, Threnody's heard. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [threnody](threnody.md)  says  [troy](troy.md)  made a Rule somewhere: anyone using Trump to attack another person gets fucked. Very few people have tried attacking via Trump, and all of them got burned. Ask  [remo](remo.md) ; he got a simulacrum of himself to attack Damion with Trump. The sim got toasted. Ask Eressea; maybe she knows more about that aspect of the Trump from her days in The Courts of Chaos. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [threnody](threnody.md)  thinks Brand got his ass toasted by attacking one of his brothers through the Trump. When was the last time anyone ever saw Brand? He used to eb 119th level. Now Fiona's 119th and Brand's only 18 or 28 or so. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Unfortunately, there is no way to block Trump contact without blocking all magic of that nature with a blanket immunity or protection. You would need an 8th level spell in order to block Trump contact. This means you would have to be 16th level magic user to do the research, or cast it from a scroll that someone else researched and made. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You may wish to seek  [morgan](morgan.md)  or Fiona on this topic. These two are noted for their examination of Trump. Also Brand, Bleys, and possibly Corwin's son Merlyn are said to have spent some time studying Trump. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  And of course, Tanngrisnir would know everything Dworkin did. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  


#### tanngrisnir on Trump

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  There was no spell for detecting or blocking Trump. The spell PORTAL was used to make them. Portal is a ninth level spell which is the reverse of GATE. Portal allows one to initiate contact in order to procure an invitation, after which enabled transportation. People noticed how powerful communication can be and made the Trump useful for that purpose more often than for their intended purpose of transportation. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  'Communication was found to include visual, psionic, and audio information. Trump could pierce certain protections and traps in order to permit the people to escape or to talk despite the defenses intervening between the involved parties. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Morgan La faye made a spell to guard against Trump contact, but Tan never saw a spellbook page to be able to describe its operation. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  If you use the Trump for attack, you will be punished. Punishment is always "sufficient to cause regret." One would imagine that using a Trump to attempt a morganti attack would involve instantaneous or pre-emptive retribution; however, historically punishment has invariably been meted _after_ the attack is complete (regardless of success or failure). No one known has dared to test this theory about instant rehabilitation for Morganti-Trump attack. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  None of the punished persons has been talkative about his or her rehabilitation. When  [remo](remo.md)  used one of his assassins to attack Damion through Trump,  [remo](remo.md)  became mirrored seventy seven thousand times in lesser, embarrassingly imperfect simulacrums on every shadow of Troad. Brand was similarly humbled on ongoing terms, when he lost his primacy to Fiona; Fiona became the Original Princess, and Brand became a second-generation Prince of Ilium. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It's also improper to mess with anyone's card but your own. If Chrys were to usurp Eresseas Trump and have it instead contact someone else, there'd be hell to pay when  [eressea](eressea.md)  objected to it. Rumour has it that's why some members of the family are no longer in favour (Brand, Fiona, Bleys, Hal). 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, it's never been against Troy's will to trap your own card. You could do anything you like to someone who uses the Trump to contact you. Chrysofar could set up an automatice-Dusting-no-save of anyone who contacts Chrys via Trump. Tangrisner thinks that Chrys would enrage  [threnody](threnody.md)  if she did this, but Chrysofar would not be abusing the Trump to do so. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  This is essentially  [troy](troy.md)  made certain people could get around any punishment for being in a bad place where receiving Trump contact initiated by someone else draws someone else into danger. "People who contact you by your Trump are placing themselves in your power," says Tan. "You did not invite their contact, so the initiator gets any danger, not you." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The bottom line. You don't mess with anyone else's card, and that includes attacking. "You will live to regret it."

####  [threnody](threnody.md)  on Dreaming and Trump

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  collect the soul of their pictured creature rather than allow it to receive the Real Death. This worked against the Morganti'd person Colbart. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The minor arcana are not all able to reach the person pictured, either because of (a) powerful magic aquired after the Trump was painted, or (b) the pictured person place or thing no longer exists. Morganti death is not protected against in the minor arcana, except perhaps from Dolkris, because it is now pictured on Erin's card ( [threnody](threnody.md)  bows). 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Trump can allow a person to observe another's dreams, or even awaken a sleeper or put a non-sleeping person to sleep.
