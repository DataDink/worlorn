>  an **ORIGINAL** stamp on a white card severs the magical link between a white card item and the colored card that created it. an ORIGINAL white card is not dismissable or alterable by the colored card weilder or inspiring deity/elemental power/muse. 
>
>  a **VOID** stamp exists in the  [dance](dance.md) , but its nature is not fully explored. a card marked VOID does not appear to be inspired by the the  [muses](muses.md)  of Dance or to be recognizable by the *Book of the New Day*.
>
>  many circumstances can apply a stamp to a white card. the assistant DM possesses the stamps as  [tokens](tokens.md)  which can be used or stolen by dancers *crossing-in-the-mist*.
