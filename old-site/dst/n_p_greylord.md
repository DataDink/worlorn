 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The initial avatar of the grey lord was a half-Wengen sorcerer of great power named  [troy](troy.md) . This image transitioned over the decades to a Florentine with great power over the mundane world, a weaponless bonze monk named  [kalkin](kalkin.md) , said to be the son of  [yama](yama.md)   [deathgod](deathgod.md) . There are some female avatars of this empty-hand warrior/wizard, and  [halfelven](halfelven.md) , and a male Kobold avatar made of gold. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  As a monk, the Grey Lord became widely known as a solid politician able to raise fierce loyalty for his causes apparently without any charming magic. A sect of the Church of the Grey Lord worships this avatar known as The Binder. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Grey Lord fights with his hands, but as a great politician, rarely needs to come to blows to reach his ends. The sorcerer weilds a staff and the bonze weilds a sword named *Aki I Tsuri*, “Red Tidings.”

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Reflection before action is rewarded, and one is bound to fulfill one's word. It is believed infinite shadows and reflections are created from one's every action, and so one must be careful lest one act in a way that ripples across the universe.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The followers of the Grey Lord place great faith in organized ritual and stricture as the proper way to walk the pattern of one's life.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The domed free city of Diaspar was created in seven days by Thiebaud, a high priest of the Grey Lord. The wall and dome appear to be constructed of one seamless Emerald. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is said Diaspar is a shadow of a prime city, called by the god's name: Troy. Unlike Troy, the city of Diaspar never fell to an attacking army, despite a ten year seige. After a decade of seige, the Theocrat called the Ground to swallow up the beseiging Necrodemian forces and be done.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Traditionally the Theocrat of the City is also the High Priest/ess of the Church of the Grey Lord. The position of Theocrat is not truly secular, for the Eressene and Hektorite orders are based in Diaspar. The city conflists are almost always based on church schisms. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Diaspar is occasionally ruled through a Nexus-8 Replicant of the city's founder Thiebaud. This magical construct is called “the Theocrat“. Only the Highest Priest of the Church of the Grey Lord may command the Theocrat. Many High Priests and Priestesses do not enjoy ruling through a construct, or fear his political power and immortality, so the Theocrat has experienced decades of freedom as well as imprisonment in the century since Thiebaud's natural life ended.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Wengens who are not coven druids tend to worship Troy the Sorcerer. Florentines tend to workship Kalkin the Binder. Kobolds tend to worship Edi Snitman, Master of Kyben.
