Subject: turf holder tutorial
a Worlorn sentient was inspired to ask:
> Can [a gold card wielder], without taking a game action and without informing
> any other turf, innately know who holds [a specific gold card] at this moment?
no. gold cards detect gold cards without an action, but they have no detection of
wielder. specific dominating personalities are not relevant to gold cards.
here are some Rules for gold cards.
--
1 gold card can detect:
- does 1 gold card now exist anywhere by the specific Name of x?
- is 1 gold card Named x touching my gold card now?
- is this specific detectable person 1 gold card?
- is this specific detectable place 1 gold card?
- is this specific detectable thing 1 gold card?
1 gold card can:
- manifest perfect domination within the archetype of its Name.
     CAVEAT: perfect domination prevails against non-archetype 
      reactions of 1 gold card. Historically, 1 gold card Named 
     ORB OF SENTIENT DRAGON CONTROL once prevailed against
     a sentient dragon wielding 1 gold card without a defensive 
     archetype Name.
- perfectly dominate a radius of area.
     AKA "create turf."
     CAVEAT: no one can dominate the unknown and undetected.
- communicate with all other gold cards. 
     CAVEAT: all gold cards can perceive all gold card communications.
- create a device bearing the name on the gold card.
     CAVEAT: No universe can exist with both irresistible forces 
     and immovable objects. All Crossing-in-the-Mist occurs in 
     the universe with irresistible forces. Think it through.
2 gold cards can cooperatively:
- perfectly dominate from 1 gold card indefinitely.
- resist domination of 1-3 cooperating gold cards.
WITHIN GOLD CARD DOMINATION
the dominator's will prevails. 
     CAVEAT: once willfully cooperating with another gold card 
     [for example, Oimota], 1 gold card no longer perfectly dominates
     its radius. Shared domination prevails until both gold cards will 
     mutual isolation.
WHAT ELSE IS THERE BESIDES GOLD CARDS?
- matter and energy dominated imperfectly by "cooperating" gold cards.
     AKA "Wasteland."
- un dominated matter and energy.
     AKA "irridisium" and "flux" respectively. 
     AKA "Sea of Chaos."
- places of no matter or energy to dominate. 
     AKA "Void."
     AKA "Greyspace."
