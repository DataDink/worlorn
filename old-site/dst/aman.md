  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Within New Troad is the Kav Elfar stronghold of Elfhome, ruled by a seven foot tall elf named Elwe. Elwe is an avatar of Elrond, the Dominator of Aman. There are certain "doorways" in Elfhome, accessible only at the permission of Elrond or Elwe, which lead to a set of dimensions known by those residents as "Aman". Please direct any inquiries to Elwe regarding those domains (or reread your Tolkien).

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Of Elrond (or Erin, as he is more commonly called) many often contradictory tales are told: peacemaker, betrayer, Roke mage, morganti wielder. Perhaps only Erin himself knows the full truth.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) In tales, Elrond was half Vanyar, half human, but chose his Elven heritage. His twin brother Elwe instead choose to be mortal.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) To be **just** is to be 

* Honorable and Fair in ones dealings and actions
* Consistent with what is morally right; righteous
* Suitable or proper in nature; fitting
* Based on fact or sound reason



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Justice** is 

* The quality of being Just; Fairness
* The principle of moral rightness, equity, Conformity to moral rightness in action or attitude.
* The upholding of what is Just, especialy fair treatment and **due reward** in accordance with **honor**, **standards**, and **law**.
* Conformity to Truth, fact, and sound reason



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) To **Do Justice** is to treat adequately, fairly and with Full Appreciation.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The concept of justice is grounded in these basic principles: 

1. Objectivity: Complete impartiality from the interests of either side. This is the fundamental principle behind things like the Exclusionary Rule. The evidence must **not** be gained unfairly, or presented biasedly.
1. Equity: Each side shall be treated as equal before the law, in judgement, and the determination must be sound and complete to the fullest extent possible by the Adjudicator to ensure each side is satisfied with the settlement and sees it as fair.
1. Sanctuary: The accused, or the accusor, is guaranteed safety from the populace, the other party, or any other aggressor while the 'Trial' is conducted, and afterward, if the 'convicted' is remanded to the hands of the Law, in that the convicted is not to be harmed by an outside entity.
1. Compassion: This is **the most important aspect of Justice**. The term Juris Prudence exactly translated means Knowledge of Law. The application is Justice tempered with compassion. Subjectivity is the greatest asset of an adjudicator of Law. The proscriptions of law may dictate one act, but the circumstances may require another to be just. The quality of Ruth is compassion, love, and altruism, that is why we describe people of excess ambition as Ruthless. Justice is **never** Ruthless.
1. Finality: Justice, when proper, closes the dispute. Its correctness is obvious; if it perpetuates the conflict, it is not proper. All parties except the irrational understand, if not agree with, the logic, and feel the decision was even-handed.

 **the high one** on Neutral Ground:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Neutral Ground** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *Justice* in worlorn.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Vanyar appear as seven foot tall elves, of blonde or white hair with blue or violet eyes. The ignorant might mistake them for tall Kav Elfar. The name "Vanyar" in their tongue literally means "Those who stayed in the Light". These creatures are exclusively Lawful, mostly Good, some Neutral, a very, very few, evil.
