# great weapons of worlorn

something borrowed
>
>   Seventeen weapons were imported into Worlorn and retained the supernatural dwoemers of the lands from which they came. It is known that while a Great Weapon exists, so lives the weirmoniken traveller who brought it hence. It is known that while the wielder lives, the weapon may not be Destroyed, Removed, Transformed, or Unmade. The weapons are presented in the order of their appearance in the  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  system.

>   The next opportunity for Great Weapon creation occurred when three weapons arrived simultaneously in the Cycle of Dreams: **Dolkris** welded by  [erin](erin.md)  called the Betrayer; **King Dancer** wielded by Gorm; and **Bruce** wielded by King Feramyr. 
>
>   However, before this Crossing-in-the-Mist, Wyrmbane had been blooded against a sentient Dragon. Whether three weapons arriving in Worlorn during a single Crossing-in-the-Mist changed the mechanism, or the failure was caused by a sentient choice, no more artifacts of the nature of Great Weapons were advanced after **Wyrmbane**. 
>
>   Dolkris eventually was taught to be Morganti, and the other two blades were well known for their powers. Other weapons of note include **Gold'n'Pretty** of Bactor, **Ellindindar** of  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) , and **Flessex**, but none of these weapons truly matched the power of the seventeen.
