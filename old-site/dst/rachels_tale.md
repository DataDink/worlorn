# rachel’s tale



a human legend of larethian

**Rachel's Tale: The Children of Rilea** 
This story was told by Rachel, an old woman of Kentucky, who heard it when she was a young girl.

 

> in ancient times before the necrodemian emperors, lios elfar roamed the
> woods freely, and were called by men the elves of light. then there was a
> time of darkness, when no children were born to the elves of light. this was
> the time of fire and demons, when the traveller came to the world and slew
> corellian larethian, the god of the lios elfar.
> if it were not for the good elf keebler, the lios elfar would have been
> driven from the world, would have been swallowed by the dark years. the good
> elf keebler made a forest of light within the forest of darkness. In this
> forest of light, there was light in the sky even at night. since then, in
> some lands, lios elfar are known as the star children. but at that time,
> only within the forest of the lord keebler could the lios elfar retire and
> be safe.
> three manlike starmages and an elven woman put an end to the dark times.
> they came to the world from another place unlike this place in almost every
> way. the three starmages were called wink, skywalker, and baker. the elf was
> named rilea. when he learned the world was without light, the starmage
> skywalker opened a gateway leading between our world and the world from
> which he came. skywalker invited corellian larethian into the world.
> corellian accepted the offer to bring light to our dark world, and once
> again there was light in our world for the lios elfar.
> corellian larethian incarnated and to prevent the traveller from realising
> his presence, was called nolerak. to bring the light back to the world,
> nolerak sired many children. to each child he gave a mark of his wisdom, and
> also a mark of his wisdom was given to his friend lord keebler. rilea was
> offered the mark of nolerak's wisdom, but deferred. nolerak promised to gift
> her children with marks, to their last number, to the end of time. skywalker
> was granted other gifts.
> the children of nolerak brought their wisdom out of keebler's forests
> within, brought the light of nolerak into the forests of the world of men.
> the traveller did not discover the light of the lios elfar until four of his
> children and the lord keebler had established enclaves of light in the dark
> forests.
> at this time the traveller brought his attention to bear. kav elfar leapt
> from their caves and two by two came forth to slay any elves of light they
> could find. those lios elfar with the wisdom of their elders could hide
> outside the sight of the traveller's kav elfar. lios elfar who ignored the
> wisdom of the elders perished by the sharp blades of the kav elfar.
> as time passed, the original children of nolerak grew weary of the world,
> and the darkness brought by men and orcs. when the moment came when they
> could no longer bear the dark places of the world, each child of nolerak
> would pass the mark of wisdom to the next younger child, and quit the lands
> of light and dark for a place of eternal light. when a holder of wisdom
> found darkness before light, the mark was held by lesser lios elfar until a
> child of nolerak should come forth and claim it.
> it is said among men that when a child of rilea came to wisdom, that this
> child would find the least wise of the mark leaders, and ask that leader to
> quit the lands of light and darkness, and retire to the lands of eternal
> light. it is said among men that on occasion the unwise children of nolerak
> were so foolish as to raise weapons or spells against the children of rilea,
> and then nolerak would come to avenge the dead. it is said among men that of
> all the marks of wisdom, only the swan have never spilled the blood of the
> children of rilea.
> there is no story among men which tells of four children of rilea coming to
> wisdom at the same time.

 
Rachel died of old age, shortly after relating this tale.
