 [roland](roland.md)  asks * Time was Remo had not failed?*

 
 Failed? Perhaps Remo just stopped playing last  [game](game.md)  when one team lost. 


 Do you recall Remo promised  [oberon](oberon.md)  never to step foot in Troy's Tesseract again? Recall that Remo has been seen by at least one iahklu, on the ex- [troad](troad.md)  turf? Know then that since the fall of Troad Remo has again been 'exiled by regents of the Necrodemian court' and has not been seen on the 'prime material' of New Troad. This story has not been pursued by iahklu in any dedicated manner. 


 iahklus commonly know Remo is Senethari [master teacher] of Chiun's  [sinanju](sinanju.md)  school, now that Chiun's been incapacitated or slain. Common rumour places this dojo in  [voidcastle](voidcastle.md) , a place somewhat hard to find, and certainly harder to leave.
