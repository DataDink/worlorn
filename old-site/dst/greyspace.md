# greyspace



 like nothing you’ve ever heard of

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  *No mind* can perceive the  [void](void.md) ; Greyspace is the most similar circumstance that can be perceived by thinking creatures. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The  around  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  is absolute and self-correcting. When something enters the Void, it soon becomes nothing. Even Worlorn itself was suffering from ennui until the Void was  [patternfall](patternfall.md)  by  [almitra](almitra.md) .
