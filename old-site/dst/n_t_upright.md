>   The Upright Man taught the Necrodemian Empire that there is honor among thieves. His private and  [upright_rules](upright_rules.md)  rules appalled as many burlgars, cutpurses, and pickpockets as they sheltered. 
>
>   The guilds of the upright men are known as Halls of the Ten Bells, due to the ten specialized skills that are taught within their walls. When one has mastered a skill, it is said the guildmaster rings a magic bell that man. 
>
>   No women are taught within the Halls of Ten Bells, although many have tried to learn the secrets.
