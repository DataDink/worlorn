# dust in the wind



 reply to Yama

Yama, 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I can do better than that on the shell. Not only will I provide 6000 for Dust Binding, but also 6000 for Redlight Binding(the Big SL'stype) from previous adventuring days gone by. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I too would agree with zero-level Florentine humans.I can also equip troops with Feathered Chariots(a gift from the frie rat who lost the item through recklessness and which I have rebound).Greylord overlap is also a good thing, what with the probabilities on their side and all. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I also plan on recalling silver shields and morningstars right before we attack, incase that will help weaken enemies. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Next thursday it thanksgiving, so will they run earlier or skip a week? 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  By opening my own vast storehouses of food stuffs to caravans from any city in need of eastern Lartroxia I believe I can win support and have little fighting occur. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I will also ask Rogue DM for a conformation on the Damion Pts in short order. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  On a note of concern, I received a message form Chrysofar about our upcoming coup. Did you mention this to her? 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I plan to strike by this sunday, so we can get ourselves entrenched deep by next play. 


Lord Kalkin The Binder

 Governor of Eastern Lartroxia
