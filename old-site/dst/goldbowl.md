a vessel carrying intangibles

 He picks up the golden bowl and turns it slowly round in his hands admiring the nifty design he put aournd the inside of the rim. For a moment a frown or scowl clouds his granite features, he still doesn't understand why his elven scribe turned white as ghost when he saw that nifty design, but in a moment the breif dismay has fled and he is once again fascinated by the bowl's elaborate engraved pattern.

  [damon](damon.md)  enters the throne room with a cautious look to left, then right. Spotting  [roland](roland.md)  at  [yama](yama.md) 's introduction he squints at the man for a long moment, then grunts. "Well met, Roland..." 


 Finally, his gaze returns to the Deathgod. "H'llo Deathgod. It's been a long time. I ain't much fer Makin' speeches. I let muh work speak fer me," as he pulls the large golden bowl out of his pack. "I made this fer ya. On account a ya having been kilt 'n all, an' o'course mostly cuz I heard ya was alive agin." He hands the  [deathgod](deathgod.md)  the simple, shallow bowl, with the odd design around the inner lip. 


 "Oh yeah, 'n also cuz ya was nice 'n let me go on about things last time I saw ya, even though ya took everyone else off ta the  [paths](paths.md) . I didn't really know what a Deathgod might need, but I figures even if'n ya don't need this here bowl, it'd go nice on some altar somewheres." 


 As  [yama](yama.md)  examines the bowl, he realizes that the elaborate design is, in fact, an elaborate script. A fact which Damon seems to be oblivious of. Nevertheless, it reads: 


```
"I wage not any fued with Death
  For changes wrought on form and face;
  No lower life that earth's embrace
May breed with him can fright my faith
Eternal process moving on,
 From state to state the spirit walks;
 And these are but the shattered stalks,
Or ruined chrysalis of one.
Nor blame I Death, because he bare
 The use of virtue out of earth;
 I know transplanted human worth
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.
For this alone on Death I wreak
 The wrath that garners in my heart:
 He put our lives so far apart
We cannot hear each other speak."

```
