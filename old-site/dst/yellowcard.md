### yellow card strange attractors

muse inspiriation

#### 

#### power
>
>  a **yellow card** represents the ability manifest inspiration by a specific named muse.
>
>  in the cycle of  [dance](dance.md) , **yellow cards** make items from dance. the rest should be obvious.

#### 

#### perfection
>
>  a **yellow card** represents the ability to make items which perfectly serve a muse. manifest **yellow card** attractors are therefore the highest order of white cards.

#### 

#### consistency
>
>  **yellow cards** make white card items which have guarantee of performance in all places and all timeframes. The muse-inspired whitecard may function in your favor, it may function in the favor of your enemy, but it will invariably function in the favor of the muse inspiring it.
>
>  only the inspiration of a muse may alter the manner in which a white card operates when that white card comes from a **yellow card**. local conditions (i.e. "circumstances") and the whims of local dominators are immaterial during the invocation of a muse-inspired white card attractor made from a **yellow card** attractor.

#### 

#### multiplicity
>
>  multiple white cards have been generated from one **yellow card**.
>
>  multiple **yellow cards** have been found to represent one particular inspiration of a given muse. 

#### 

#### dismissal
>
>  no entity may dismiss white card attractors inspired by a muse. a **yellow card** wielder may petition the inspiring muse to withold inspiration, but it's generally considered futile.
