# Krimtag Gatmirk

 mortal predecessor to  [ko](ko.md)
>
>   Before apotheosis, Ko was a paladin named Krimtag Gatmirk, serving Bragi the Norse god. Krimtag slew the Crossime Lord of Death with the Weapon Greyswandir ending all magic in the world. 
>
>   His friend  [hal](hal.md)  tells stories of growing up with a Paladin so very strong in his song and storytelling that his peers called him “the Bard.” Other stories include accompanying Krimtag to saving of the Platinum King Bahamut, and rewards of a Silver Dragon consort for each. While the name of this dragon is not recorded, their only daughter, Miranes Gatmirk, was the mother of Morgan La Faye. 
>
>   In the world he visited after Crosstime, Krimtag saved a sentient race from extinction, and was invited to ascend to greater godhood. 
>
>   Hallenrakenthaller often joked that Krimtag used apotheosis as a remedy for depression. Krimtag’s daughter Miranes was occasionally heard to say her father had chosen to slay one million people in order to save a race of twelve million people, and had become suicidal. She was also heard to say her father would have departed mortal life regardless, but took a path where he could Improve any existence wherein such choices have to be made.
