>  the comyn are a mixed bag as a people their skin ranges from a almost translucently pale white to a dark red brown. hair and eye color are similarly diverse. approximately one out of every ten comyn have some level of psionic ability. these psionically endowed comyn are usually easily identifiable by red hair and blue or green eyes. there is a tradition of service and deference to these psionically gifted individuals. the majority of the population treating them as nobility and they themselves sacrificing their services to their people. some of these gifted individuals have rejected this selfless service and gone out to wander the world interbreeding with other people and spreading the psionic abilities. psionically gifted comyn often amplify their natural abilities by use of laran-crystals, psionic amplifying tokens from the diamond stone.
