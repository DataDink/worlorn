### **white card strange attractors**



worlorn system's enchanted items





  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) in worlorn system, sentients prove possession of the typical magic item with a 3" x 5" white index card with the item name. white cards representing magic items are called strange attractors. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **white cards** represent magic items, and the various **colored cards** represent the ability to make magic items. each type of card acts differently, with only white cards having a physical manifestation perceivable by player characters.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the sentient player must possess such a card or her character is not able to weild the item's power throughout all planes and turfs. this system was implemented by turfweilders to track natural magic items during an era of sentient cheating. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) if a sentient has the file card for a ring of protection, then an iahklu or *er-per’henne* belonging to that that sentient player may use the ring on any turf or plane in worlorn. if the character doesn't have the card, then the character can't use the item. without a card, the ring is not guaranteed to function even on the plane where it was obtained. note also that the effectiveness of a white card is determined by local conditions.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) if you have trouble, memorize this as a mantra:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) a white card represents a magic item, and a colored card represents the ability to make an item.

 






### **stamped white cards**



stranger attractors than most





  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) some cards have colored stamps on them. generally the stamp is a permanent change in the nature of the card, but makes no change to the operations of the item represented by the card. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) refer to  [stampcard](stampcard.md)  for the meaning of stamps on cards.

### **legendary explanation**



at first we didn't succeed





 * How do I get colored cards for my outworld items? or are they white card things?* 
  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) All items are represented by white file cards. No colored card represents a physical item, only white cards. Anyone with a true name may use an item represented by a colored card.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Colored cards represent an ability to manifest an item. Colored cards may not be weilded safely or carried or stolen except by brownsheet characters or wielders of gold cards (who must be brownsheets). Using a colored card withou; having your stats locked by a brownsheet wil cost you: levels, stat points, deaths, etc. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Compact is essentially a mondo colored card with specific programming.

#### Carded Magic Items

 


  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Without a compact, only magic items of absolute power (such as 'Roke Artifacts') operate in all places and all times. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Forseeing the Downfall of Troad and the Sixth Compact, the Half-elven One created an archetypal magic item distribution system at Hissarlik to make undeniable magic items which operate in the Wasteland, as well as every Worlorn Turf.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) In other words, Troy Ounces made a magic factory where any Name Level First Edition D&D character could go and find magic items that will operate anywhere on Worlorn No Matter What. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The DM represents such archetypal magic items with a 3" x 5" file card imprinted with the items's name.

 


 *No nono no more 3X5 cards TYPEd yet...no. (The DM is turned to Dust...)* 


  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) [Dust? DM saves with a 20.]

 


  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Carded items are like Roke Artifacts, in that they are guaranteed to operate (to some extent of their purpose) no matter where on Worlorn they are weilded. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) These 'carded items' may be weilded only by beings with True Names, I.E.: typically only first edition characters who have reached Name Level of experience have the existence to weild such powerful items. Likewise, most beings with True Names may not be harmed in the Wasteland by items which fail to be represented by cards.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) There is also a 'colored card' flavor of magic item. These may be weilded safely only by creatures on laminated (i.e. unchangable) character sheets or Brownsheets protected by outbangles. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Thus, magic items of power continue to be represented on 3x5 cards. If a player possesses a card, then that is proof that an eligable character may possess the item. Posession is 10 tenths of the Law of the Wasteland. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Since cards are Roke Magic ratification of an item, all carded magic items (AKA Strange Attractors AKA Magical Archetypes) operate regardless of desires or intentions of Turfholders.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Second edition characters may weild only non-carded items in eD&D. Note that first edition characters are generally not affected by attacks or benefits of non-carded magic items used by second edition characters.
