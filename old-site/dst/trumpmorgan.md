Trump to Morgan la Faye
The picture fades to black. There is no vision, only voices in Wengen. They
do not appear to hear the trump holder.
WOMAN [tired ]
"Bismillah, Malik. I fooled them. The gith want me, they do not make the lie
to it. Oh, Kori, so glad you are come, seeing you again--"
MAN:
"God, Morgan, What are we going to do? Why did you lie to--" [sound of a body
falling, and a man's exclamation, followed by rapid footsteps.]
WOMAN [muttering disjointed]:
"the clan was not betrayed...the tribes must be protected...kill me, Kori,
and avenge me with honor." [Stronger] "Malik, I have no more strength for
lying, no more fight in me. Only sleep I need. Safe sleep, no harm--one night
do we have? One night for spending? Then--"
MAN:
"Shut up, by god shut up, Morgan..." [movement against clothing, a kiss. ] 
WOMAN:
"So good that you came. Tomorrow, the Festival of a Thousand Teardrops. I
feared to hope for it." 
MAN
Look, I've kept one promise, and I'll make you more. You don't have to go
there. You don't have to die. I have it all worked out. Don't be afraid. I'll
care for you Morgan. I love you--shit."[Footsteps, snaps and buckles. More
footsteps. ] "Look in here. We've got all sorts of stuff for you. You take a
bath and I'll explain to you. Are you hungry? Did they let you eat? Do you
--"
WOMAN
"No, no, Kori. Just sleep, and peace tomorrow. Peace, no more questions.
Many...Kori, do not cry. And before I said, there is no loving one who is
what I...have become. I do not love myself. You must not either. Plan, or
asasha, or chefir--do you have these?"
MAN
"No. Yeah, Wait a minute." [Footsteps receeding far.]
WOMAN [whispering]
"They are beautiful." [Buckles and snaps. growing sounds of a woman weeping
freely. Footsteps return, water dribles in a bowl. ]
MAN 2 [distant]
"How's it going?"
MAN
[Yells]"Get out of here." [door slams. Voice quiter: ] "You'll feel stronger
in a minute. When you want to be reasonable, we'll talk this out. [someone
blows a nose. ] "Look here, Morgan--" [starts in Wengen, switches to faerie.]
White owl feathers. Blue Stars. [fanfare.] A letter from the Games Authority
guaranteeing sanctuary. You must choose."
WOMAN
"Kori, you will not let me explain. It is honor. One must be strong. I am not
strong--" 
[A short pop. A falling body. Eight and a half hours of silence. Footsteps
approach. ]
MAN 2 [gently.]
"Born again, Korian."
MAN
[sobs.]
Displaced contact ends. Trump contact for Morgan la Faye returns to normal
time, and the card's behavour is consistent with a card for one who has died
of natural causes.
