### diGriz's Treatise on Reality 

 
 *Written in Truespeech, knowing no impediments, but communicated as a fire rat, which necessitates impediments. Practitioners educated at Roke may read these lines unimpeded.* 


 Be warned that reading of this treatise beyond this this sentence may constitute the use of a magic item.

```
Tick tocks
bowls clatter
death whispers
life shouts
order paces
chaos clamors
water gurgles
fire crackles
wind whistles
ground rumbles
children laugh
void
Red as Blood
Dry as Dust
Bright as night
Dark as dusk
See your love
Trap the soul
Find your self
Robe and bowl
What's going on?
State your goal
Start the game
Play the fool

```

 Let it be known that I have done things that may have been forgotten over the years, but which have solidified some of the ideas covered within these pages.

1. To be above a game, you may not participate in the game.
1. Anyone participating in a game must perform according to the rules of the game. Breaking the rules implies that you are no longer playing the game.
 Conversely, if you "break" the rules and are still playing the game, either the rules have changed to accomodate you, you never broke a rule in the first place, or you had been or are currently playing a different game from the one you believed you were playing. Everyone is either a player or a non-player.


 There are two choices available to players: passive and active. Passive players are impacted by and/or have an indirect impact on the game. Active players are both impacted by and have a direct impact on the game. There are two choices available to non-players: non-participant, and controller. A non-participant is not impacted by and has no direct or indirect impact on the game.


 A controller may be of two types: permissive and absolute. The permissive controller makes allowances so that they may occasionally play the game. The absolute controller chooses not to participate at all costs, and only seeks to establish the rules by which all players must adhere. Any player is potentially a controller.
1. There are at least six ranks of existence. I have personally interacted with a sixth rank of creature; the rest of the world only suspects that six ranks exist.
 Given this fact, there are at least 7 ranks of controllers. Whether there is more than one controller at any given level is another matter entirely.


 To my knowledge, no controller at 5th rank or higher has died an irrevocable Real Death. The Real Death has no meaning to any creature of less than 5th rank. The wathan is consumed, but the controller of the wathan persists.


 [This means that  [ko](ko.md)  is not dead, and has never died. It was not possible.]
1. Reality is always in flux.
1. Reality is always balanced.
 The fact that reality exists is testament to it's inherent balance. Mother Nature will not permit existence without balance. At the very least, there have always been positive and negative energy, and Chaos and the Void. These four agencies are largely uncontrolled. I have not explored the poles of "that which is not energized", "that which needs no energy", "that which is always Named," "that which is not Named." I believe that these eight energies, at least, will always exist to some degree, ensuring an enduring balance for reality.
1. The balance would exist without Roke.
1. Roke is not superfluous to the balance.
 What is the balance? Ah, the incredible obtuse question. The balance is that which without we would not be able to exist. Awfully self-serving, eh? Well, mortals are like that. Even monster mortals. We'd all like to survive. The balance gives us a reason to survive, and the rationale to survive. There is no magic to it, there is no real power.


 The balance is derived from an understanding of one's place in the universe, and how to maximize our potential within that place. It was Troy's task
1. The rules of reality are not arbitrary.
1. The rules of reality are undefined.
1. Defining reality limits possibilties.
1. Obscuring reality generates possibilities.
1. The struggle for power is contention is in amassing rules to benefit oneself or one's agency.
1. The struggle for power is irrelevant to defining reality.
1.
