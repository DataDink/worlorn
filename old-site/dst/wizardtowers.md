# wizard towers

great works of architecture
>
>   there were 28 wizard towers created as a  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  of a melnibonean elf: corum jhalien irsei, one of the Roke Mages. such towers offered an attuned owner "competence" within their walls, and nullified the competence of others within their walls. attunement was cancellable only by the death of the mage-owner.
>
>   the laboratory in the top floor assured perfect item enchantment execution as well as enhanced spell research. the owner could invoke "guards and wards" defence at will, or set such to appear without concentration when the tower was under attack. regent callion reported the halls were filled with fog during the hellene attack on the court of necrodemus VI, the high one, at carsultyl keep ten years ago in 79 necrodemus.
>
>   wizard towers are grey-white stone, similar to granite, eight storeys (240') tall with no guaranteed basement. they are cylindrical with a radius of over 200'. the blueprint was consistently applied to all 28 structures according to legend. there is a large doorway on the ground floor and balconies at various heights. there is a vast dining hall, ceiling two stories above, with a gallery on three sides.
>
>   although there are stairwells and ladders to move between floors, there were also on some levels "golden-floored teleport chambers" which allowed error-free teleportation, and without a feather from the owl robe or eagle robe. the robe wearers could not intercept gold-chamber teleportation from within a tower. unconfirmed third- and fourth-hand reports suggest that certain golden-chambers or towers could teleport persons _between_ wizard towers, like the gold disks of the hellenes in the imperial cities (historians high-ironjade vikary and high-shanagate villers uncharacteristically agree in this inter-tower teleportation matter).

>   not all the towers have been known to civilization. of the 28, here are the few common legends.
