>  Tanngrisnir created New Troad to reflect the  [pattern](pattern.md)  of  [dworkin](dworkin.md) . However, Tanngrisnir added eight veils to Dworkin's twenty-veil Pattern, and these additional veils sustained New Troad through the end of the Cycle of Dreaming.

>  The geography of the troad starts with the continent of Lartroxia.  [watersea](watersea.md)  ports exist on all coastlines, notably  [portsuame](portsuame.md)  and New Nostoblet. The Isle of Sleep can be found on one Lartroxian inland sea, properly called the Lake of Dreams.

>  Tanngrisnir is wengen male youth in his late teens/early twenties. He a student of the bonze emptyhand fighting ways, 'killer-a' dojo, and has some skill as a wizard.

>  The Order of the Worlorn System in previous cycles was a reflection of Dworkin's Pattern. With Almitra's Fluxing of that Pattern, Worlorn became a sea of Chaos, broken only by the will of wielders sustained through nearly thirty Gold Attributes.
>
>  With the aid of  [highone](highone.md) , Tanngrisnir is gradually bringing the order of the Pattern back throughout Worlorn.

>  The Maker of Rules is a pendant on an unbroken chain carved from a single emerald. It is the centerpiece of the prime trio of Trojan artifacts: The Bringer of Order, the Maker of Rules, and The Jewel of Judgement. With the maker, Troy was able to re-arrange the reality which the bringer formed out of Chaos.
>
>  wielding the maker is dangerous, as it draws from the life force and dreams of the bearer, regardless of that entity's intent. This drain is frequently perceived as a slowing of time, allowing the bearer to react faster than the environment would normally permit. Actually placing the chain around one's neck causes non-trojans to die, and bears down a trojan mightily, as if the weight of a world was on his or her shoulders. While the chain is worn around one's neck, the maker causes all supernatural attacks on its wielder to be befuddled to reflect upon the attacker sevenfold, regardless.
>
>  The Maker of Rules is a token granted by the Emerald Stone in the Courts of Chaos. Through this gem, Dworkin was able to cause his will to be reflected in reality, thus creating Troad.

 **the high one** on The Maker of Rules:
>
>  the **maker of rules** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *order* in worlorn, including but not limited to creation, arbitration, and enforcement of any compact(s) between worlorn turf. the laws of blood, dust, billykins and tiresias are upheld and modified over time with the whim of the wielder of the maker of rules.

>  While the traditional bloodline of Troy is still potent in the faerie and grey elfar, the mortal race sponsored by the Troad is the Wengen people, a negroid race of humans. Wengen are a dreaming race, and highly-prone to psionic ability.
>
>  Wengen society is typically that of coven druids, with those not part of the deepwoods society scorned as 'cowan' folk. Wengen who have actually pledged to a coven circle won't even speak to cowan races.
>
>  The highest population of Wengen people in Lartroxia is in the West, where Troy Ounces is said to have settled with his sister while studying Worlorn in the first years.
