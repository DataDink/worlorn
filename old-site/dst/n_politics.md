>   The newly founded Necrodemian Empire granted land and political power to four official social castes, that came to be called estates. The fifth estate has never been granted an official voice in Necrodemian politics.

**noble warriors**

the first estate
>
>   The  [n_fighter](n_fighter.md)  caste was founded on the ideal of the honorable warrior, with citizens being banned from carrying all but the three “honor weapons“ in public places. Weapons bans persisted until the rule of Necrodemus III, when holdfast kav elfar won the right to bear their holdfast longswords within Necrodemian law. 
>
>   While anyone with sufficient funding could carry the first sword, the *i*, displaying a weapon was a claim to martial prowess, an open invitation to challenge in a formal legal duel. The victor won the weapon of the loser. Carrying the second honor weapon, the *mai*, was a claim to earned advanced martial training, which brought its own challenges and civil duels. Only a suicide would challenge someone carrying the third sword, the *oude*

**pious clergy**

the second estate
>
>   The  [n_priest](n_priest.md)  was founded on eight officially condoned churches. Worship outside the Necrodemian Pantheon of religions was punishable in civil court, by death. While Necrodemain law did not demand religious donation, many cities had their own local ordinances, especially the towns holding a Telesterion, the high altar to one of the eight religions.

**the talented artisan**

the third estate
>
>   The  [n_artisan](n_artisan.md)  guilds accounted for sufficient wealth that the politicians could not ignore their presence. With Necrodemian imposed constraints on inter-planar access, Wizards banded together to form schools to amass political power, and those with other more mundane skills formed guilds with similar intent: to obtain a voice in the government.

**the dedicated farmer**

the fourth estate
>
>    [n_farmer](n_farmer.md)  and agriculture was by far the most common profession of the Necrodemian territories. This populace was recognized with a voice in government. To buy citizenship in the Necrodemian City Councils cost one thousand gold ounces per annum, the entire wages of a normal workhand for almost three years. Farmers formed cooperatives in which all would contribute to a council seat for one or more member each year.

**merchants**

necessary evil
>
>    [n_merchant](n_merchant.md)  clans were never officially recognized by the Necrodemian government, but their vast wealth gained undeniable unofficial recognition. Eventually the merchant clans came to be known as Noble Houses.
