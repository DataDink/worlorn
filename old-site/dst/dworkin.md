#### tanngrisnir on dworkin

 Dworkin never minded himself about simulacrums and any chance of preserving them until quite some time after he aquired Troad. When 17 out of 26 died in a single battle he finally stopped making replacements and gave full life instead to the nine survivors, and called them the Princes. 
 *Why did Troy make you originally?* 


 Ask Oberon. I tend to believe Dworkin wanted a living data bank of information and personality in the case of amnesia or magical curse. I believe he wanted me for being Troy, not for doing his dirty work for him. 


 That's why I'm still alive. Except for the Princes, every last one of the pre-Troad simuacrums is dead. Troy was a harsh master. Forgive me; Dworkin was a harsh master.
