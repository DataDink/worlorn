### mint card strange attractors

consistent magic

#### 

#### power
>
>  a **mint card** represents the ability make an item of certain power to prevail within strictly defined overriding objectives. 
>
>  in the cycle of  [dance](dance.md) , **mint cards** make items from chaos. in the cycle of  [dreams](dreams.md) , **mint cards** made items from nothing: from the void, *ex nihilum*. in the cycle of  [history](history.md) , **mint cards** made items from memories. in the cycle of  [astronomy](astronomy.md) , **mint cards** made items from cosmic rays. in the cycle of  [comedy](comedy.md) , **mint cards** made items from various humors.

#### 

#### perfection
>
>  a **mint card** represents the ability to make items which perfectly serve strictly defined overriding objective regardless of local conditions. manifest **mint card** attractors are therefore among the middle order of white cards.

#### 

#### consistency
>
>  **mint cards** make white card items (artifacts) which have guarantee of performance in all places and all timeframes. local conditions cannot disenfranchise a **mint card** artifact from its strictly defined overriding objective. the white card manifestation of a **mint card** functions within its archetype or puropse *NO MATTER WHAT*. 
>
>  a **mint card** artifact functions within its strictly defined overriding objective regardless of local conditions and regardless of whims of the dominator. invoking the strictly defined overriding objective has no effect on local conditions beyond the strictly defined overriding objective.
>
>  during the invocation of the strictly defined overriding objective of a **mint card** artifact, the whims of local dominators are immaterial and *do not prevail*, although local dominators of course may simultaneously respond within their own archetype. surviving dominators may react to **mint card** artifact invocation only in timeframes after the artifact invocation.

#### 

#### multiplicity
>
>  multiple white cards may not be generated from one **mint card**.
>
>  multiple **mint cards** may not exist representing one particular type of strange attractor. 

#### 

#### dismissal
>
>  a **mint card** wielder may dismiss its white card attractor (manifest artifact) in one round while crossing-in-the-mist occurs under the inspiration of a  [muses](muses.md) . this one-round invocation is required regardless of whether the **mint card** weilder is crossing-in-the-mist of worlorn, or without inspiration.
>
>  when not crossing-in-the-mists of worlorn, a **mint card** wielder may dismiss the manifestation of the strange attractor controlled by that **mint card** within the constraints of continuously forward moving time.
