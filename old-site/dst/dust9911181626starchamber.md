# dust in the wind



 Chrysofar’s deeds

Chrysofar ... 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I have pleaded with thee to remove the effect that you have placed upon the wind. Blood does not kill, it sends the afflicted to another place. While I do not approve of Blood's tactics, you are killing ... and we expect more from you. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You shall find no solitude until you undo the wrong you have placed upon our world. I fear that if you do not recant and continue instead to hold onto this position that Blood must remove their effect before you do, we, as your peers, will be forced to inact an ancient rite that will, in effect, strip you of all connection to this world. We cannot take your gold attribute without attacking -- but we can sever all ties you have to our world. You will be but an island unto yourself, floating in the void of nothiness, returned to wherever you came from. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? This is my last effort to restore you to the good will of your peers. Please recant, let us put this behind us, and learn to work together. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  *IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER* 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  As a turf holder, this whole dust and blood thing is insignificant. As an agent of a diety, this whole dust and blood thing is insignificant. In those two roles, I really don't care if my worshippers are blood or dust .... I don't care if I'm we are granting sanctuary to blood or dust. Perhaps you have lost your focus ... perhaps being a turf holder is incompatible with your goals. Perhaps you should consider returning to the ranks of a doer -- when was the last time we blinked or intervene in something a NON-TURF holder did?
