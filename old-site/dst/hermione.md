  [traveller](traveller.md)  one-in-a-million girl

[top](#top) 
>
>  **hermione** is a woman, said to be a pale shadow of klesst silverhand, hermione's cousin. considering dark helen was a pale shadow of hermione's mother, this shadow business may not be as bad as it seems. she is twin to her brother, richelieu's son. **hermione's **other twin brother is barrion of windhaven.
>
>  **hermione** stands approximately 5'6" tall, and weighs 116 pounds, like virtually every elfar you know. duh!
>
>  **hermione** has been a daughter, a mother, a wife, and a dominator. sometimes the boundaries are not so keen. she has been an illithid as well as a goldcard weilder, and boy, that was a trip! brains! send more cops!
>
>  she learned a lot from riding the gold road. **hermione **is a competent fighter/magic user when she's not stealing hearts or gemstones. she's not a competent thief; like, what fun is there in that? however, **hermione** is very, very good. her teachers include margeaux escargot and talbot and barrion, kiron and boz and kem, salt peter and queen mother and necrodemus, and even that sniveling whiner Acreon was able to come up with a few new tricks for her to steal.
>
>  she stole the orb of kings, despite the legends saying only a man can touch it. **hermione** gave the orb away afterwards, to her good friend necrodemus, so he could become emperor. what a silly fellow.
>
>  in addition to the  [FIXME: attribute](attribute.md) , **hermione **weilds those annoying flat-13 save items from knock: master control devices for mind flayers (illithids), gith (a superset of humans), and elementals. she's always on the lookout for more master control devices, but she won't pay for them. just tell her where they are and she'll give you the big bucks.
>
>  she prefers to wear light colored chemises and laces under leather. and oh, yeah, long gloves and boots. loooong gloves. she likes any sort of jewelry, especially dangly things like pendants and earrings, especially on special occasions, especially when she doesn't have to go out to find the pretty ones herself, waldann...

>  **hermione** is blonde! a hyuh-eyh! ;-)
