 Damon Maker is safe? Damon's Call

"I got bett'r things ta do th'n kickin' th' bucket." He turns back
to his anvil an hefts a hammer, pausing for a moment as an object
catches his eye. Letting the hammer hang by his side, he gives the
water bucket near the Blue-eyed anvil a swift kick, which sends if
sailing down the length of Kaldamaaren and caroming off the far
walls. His lips split into a stone-cold grin. "Hrm, Now that's
done with." He arcs the hammer back up over his shoulder and
turns once again to the anvil.
