# dust in the wind



 assault

Lord Yama, Ruler of Western Lortroxia, 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sorry for the mix up on attack dates. Now is the time to strike. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I have supplied your troops not only with the afore mentioned conch shells, but also feathered chariots to use as needed.Troops from both armies may also use Swords of the Snake as per florentine Army, as well as rods of binding or any other item useable by Flortine troops. (see Book of New Day, 11.5.10) Items have been recalled and redistributed to all needed troops. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  At this time I am scrapping the Billykin pt option. At first I thought I was going at this alone and it seemed a good idea, but now things have changed... 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Machavelli is open to suggestions from you as needed, as it the mastif general. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Consider 3000 troops from Florence attacking at this time. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I stand by, with the Rod of Imperial Might, looking through the Reflecting Pool in The Fountainhead, to see if any archtype intervines, if so I will inform you immediately. I would hope a Blood archtype intervines. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Assault at Am or Pm redlight would be good, to keep Clerics out of the battle at first, as well as weary wizards. 


 - Lord Kalkin the Binder, Governor of Eastern Lartroxia
