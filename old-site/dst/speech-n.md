# niteblade's farewell



speech to the moonknights

*This speech is recorded as the words of  [niteblade](niteblade.md)  after his final battle before coming to  [asteroid](asteroid.md) .*
  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Greetings my fellow Knights. We have much to celebrate. Our order has assured peace in the Atlantean World. We have driven back the forces of darkness and evil! Good now rules supreme!

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I began my life on your world a young, dark eleven warrior ... a prince of an underworld land known as Misthaven who had rebelled against his upbringing and the evil ways of the Drow race. I sought to rise above my upbringing and to make the world a better place to live in. There was no one more proud of this personal geos and as such, my kindred deity smiled upon me. She blessed my walk in this world and I serve her with the highest sense of duty and distinction.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I gained the power of the ring in Thyl, near the dwarven bordertown of Rorshaclopar. I gained the crown on the isle of MU where I fought my first Deathknight. I gained the first half of the sword here as Mestea, before the awakening. This power was later bonded with me at the Isle of MU in the Pool of Dreams. I fought long and hard to restore the Orders of the Rose, choosing the Yellow as my kindred own. I sought to restore the White, Black, Red, Silver, and Blue to their rightful roles and set at the ruling council who chose their leaders from the Shadowgroup I formed. I wielded the dragonlance BITTERSWEET and rode the dragons REALORAN and LYSTORIA to battle against the evil dragons allied with the DeathKnight King. I fought the King of the DeathKnights in mortal combat and slew him forever. Together, we have ensured that his dark GODS and dark TIMES will not return to this land. It has been a good life ... and I am honored to serve you as your friend and as your king.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) To Raven, my first and only love, I know you can hear me. I wear the Ring of Rememberance and remember all. I was honored to be your bodyguard. Our purposes were one. I remember when we first discovered the love we shared. Oh how I sometimes long for those days. You were so radiant and our dreams became realities in the light of our love. I remember our wedding on your Isle. Realoran really put on a show for us and the dragons rendered us the greatest salute. The stone I gave you glistened in the moonlight and our friends cheered us to our honeymoon place. On the Isle of Dreams we bonded ... forever with to blood of love ...

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) ... (sadly) alas, our son came forth from that bond. He learned so quickly. I was so proud of him, as I know you were also. My killing of the King of the DeathKnights ... while I thought it would ... did not lessen the loss. My heart fell still with the evil destruction of his spirit....

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I could not serve you my love. Nor could you be married to one who did not wish the throne of a god. My love for you is eternal and I will come if you need me ... Farewell for now my love ... your former moonknight and eternal husband.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Peace has come to our world my people and as such, peace must be maintained. The Brother and Sisterhood of the Rose will ensure this. With these words and with great sorrow, I must leave this plane ... I am called by Shal-Omnis to sleep for a time ... until, the dark storms again begin to billow on the horizon. If you need me, call to me at my throne and I will appear ... for we are of one mind and spirit and my thoughts will be forever of you.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Farewell ... my people, my knights, and my love ....
