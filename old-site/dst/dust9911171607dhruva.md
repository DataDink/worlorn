# dust in the wind



 blas from the past

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) , defender of  [troy](troy.md) . 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A Chrysofar who is no more, and a defender of no one. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Who holds no power in check. For whom no life has value. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Who has lost sight of herself. . . is that a fate worse than the real death? 


 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A pity how the Winds have changed, how unsubtle the  [game](game.md)  has become.  [hell](hell.md) , shall we all break out our armaments for the pettiness and injury of one? 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  ("Wah, wah," the baby cries, "I already have a bright shiny, but I don't want anyone else to have one either!") 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A pity.
