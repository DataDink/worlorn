# reach di kendol



a report to all interested parties

This is the chronicle of Reach di Kendol, Lord Ironmark, School of the Hawk. It is made available to all in the hopes that interests will be made clear regarding the direction and effort required to awaken my lord  [digriz](digriz.md) .

 

> 
> 	My lord diGriz is sleeping a dreamless sleep. I did not want to believe   
> 	it until I saw it for myself.
> 	Everyone made way for me to view him. . . I renewed my pledge, gave what   
> 	honor I could. Still he would not wake for me.
> 	I considered my absence from him preparation, not separation. I hope I   
> 	was not mistaken.
> 	Many people were speaking to a fire outside.
> 	I surmise my lord diGriz created that fire, which appears to burn without
> 	consumption. It was comforting to stand near, but if I had stood any longer than I did, it   
> 	would have been undeserved, for I do not know how to recover my lord   
> 	diGriz. But I continue to search.
> 	I have recently been enlightened that I am er per’ henne, which either   
> 	encompasses "follower or flotsam" or "those who have more fun". I am not   
> 	sure. My lord diGriz is not er per’ henne. He is one known as Iahklu,   
> 	which encompasses either “mover or shaker,” or “those who have to do all   
> 	the work.” I believe that it is partly because I am er per’ henne that I   
> 	cannot wake my lord. I do not know this to be fact.
> 	The facts I know them are these:
> 	
> 		My lord diGriz is asleep. He will not awaken.
> 		He appears ill, wan, wasted.
> 		Josie says he is resting.
> 		Josie also said 7 creatures who had been his friends stood against him   
> 		before he succumbed to his sleep.
> 	
> 	These 7 were:
> 	
> 	Almitra of Llewghund
> 	Tanngrisner of New Troad
> 	Eressea of Dolbedarn
> 	Yama Dharma of Paths of the Dead
> 	Paris of the Fountains of Paradise
> 	Prince Who Was 1000 of Watersea
> 	Threnody of Flambeau
> 		(for some reason, Josie could not speak Threnody's name,
> 			and Aleksander had to speak for her)
> 	
> 	When I last crossed in the mist, I believe I met two of these entities,   
> 	Yama and Almitra, within Llewghund.
> 	Yama claims to not have known my lord diGriz or interacted with him for   
> 	the last 4 years. I do not know if I believe him, but I cannot help but   
> 	feel a sense of kinship and trust I do not fully understand.
> 	Almitra claims she would have helped my lord diGriz if she had been in   
> 	complete control of her demense. She claims that she is second in power.   
> 	She claims that my lord may have mistaken her inability to help him as   
> 	unwillingness to help him.
> 	From further conversation with Almitra, I was led to believe that my lord   
> 	diGriz wanted to move the entity that was truly in control of Llewghund.   
> 	To where, I have not discovered. With what means I have not discovered.   
> 	For what purpose I have not discovered.
> 	I do not know if I believe her, but I sensed a certain indignance during   
> 	the explanation of her situation. But for this I might have doubted her   
> 	story in its entirety.
> 	So far, I intuit that perhaps Iahklu, as movers/shakers/workers, must do   
> 	something to awaken my lord diGriz, for an er per’ henne cannot do it   
> 	alone. I have tried. As I speak with the others who stood against him, I   
> 	will strive to discover what happened, and why, and how to safely wake my   
> 	lord diGriz.
