  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Dragon Isles are an archipelago in the  [watersea](watersea.md)  of Worlorn. The shipping lanes of the Phoenecian Elfar and the Islanders steer clear of these islands, when they can. Tales tell of at least eight such islands known to have been visited by the brave or foolish. Three,  [elidor](elidor.md) ,  [losendos](losendos.md) , and  [mestea](mestea.md) , have dominators of their own, but the others must be assumed to be home to Dragons alone.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Evil dragons thrive in the Dragon Isles, while good ones weep in submission to them.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Dragons reveal their secrets to few, and Evil dragons do not submit, although good dragons, especially gold ones, may be subdued and captured alive.
