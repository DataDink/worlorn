### pink card strange attractors

elemental focuses

#### 

#### power
>
>  a **pink card** represents the ability make an item from a fragment of a specific named elemental power. elemental powers include the wielders of ged's rings of fire, wind, water, and ground, as well as the entity rulers of the elemental planes.
>
>  although many philosophies include void as the fifth element, there are no known **pink cards** representing the power to distribute fragments of the void.
>
>  the power of **pink cards** is not known to be linked with the substance called "*pinque*," from knock.
>
>  in all cycles, **pink cards** make items from the named element.

#### 

#### perfection
>
>  a **pink card** represents the ability to make items which perfectly serve a elemental power. manifest **pink card** attractors are therefore among the middle order of white cards.

#### 

#### consistency
>
>  **pink cards** make white card items which have guarantee of performance in all places and all timeframes. The elementally inspired whitecard may function in your favor, it may function in the favor of your enemy, but it will invariably function in the favor of the elemental power inspiring that whitecard.
>
>  only the will of the inspiring elemental power may alter the manner in which a white card operates when that white card comes from a **pink card**. local conditions (i.e. "circumstances") and the whims of local dominators are immaterial during the invocation of a elementally-inspired white card attractor made from a **pink card** attractor.

#### 

#### multiplicity
>
>  multiple white cards may be generated from one **pink card**.
>
>  multiple **pink cards** may exist representing one particular type of strange attractor. 

#### 

#### dismissal
>
>  a **pink card** wielder may not dismiss white card attractors. a **pink card** wielder may petition the inspiring elemental power to dismiss white card attractor(s) inspired by that elemental power. **ALL** white card manifestations of **pink card** strange attractors are controlled by the elemental power inspiring the white card attractor.
