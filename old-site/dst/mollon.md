# mollon’s tale



while marcellus was sleeping

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mollon Nightingale is regarding Marcellus inscrutably from across the room. He sits with his back against the wall of the tree, legs stretched in front and crossed at the ankle. Marcellus thinks of how much trouble he would have rising from that position, and how fast he’s seen Mollon leap up without using his hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The hollow baobab tree is about 30 feet across. Mollon nods as he sees Marcellus taking in the increased space, and then Mollon Nightingale speaks:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The visitor did that. When Mack stuck his head inside the tree it was less than ten feet across. Then he stepped in—through the wood—and there was suddenly more than enough room for him to strut about, wagging his baton at us each time he made a conversational point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) That’s what he did. This Mack fellow startled us by sticking his face in through the wall and coming right on in without an invitation. He didn’t open the door, his face appeared through the wall, like he was passing through water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack was dressed just as we saw him last: green and white jesters suit, matching hat, and that baton capped by a tiny head. He had no response when we told him Ooskar had charmed him asleep, but thought it merry that you had touched his baton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Misty and Ooskar greeted him by name, but Mack didn’t react. He seemed quite taken aback that we recognized him, but he denied a previous meeting only once before asking questions about our memories. Misty and Crimson mentioned more than once that we met on a different timeline, telling him that the lost time was one in which Mack saved us from Mort, which started Mack on a different line of questioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I think Misty and Crimson were giving more information than they received. Carlos of Elidor was mentioned, as well as the traveller. Mack seemed dismissive hearing that they thought the traveller or his Road was responsible, and said time-travel was not the traveller’s way. They spoke of the road taking people to other times, which Mack did not contradict, but he remained dismissive. This was when Ryndall mentioned Carlos of Elidor, as the King of the North. There was extended discussion of whether Carlos ruled in the North or the South of Elidor, and then the Jester stopped pursuing the past.  | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack announced he wanted us to sign contracts in our blood. our promise was to sleep through some event he could not explain, for which we would be given something beyond our imaginations. Of course, Ryndall quibbled about how we could ask for anything in that category, forcing Mack to admit that we’d have to be limited by our imagination then. Much attention was given for a remarkably short time to what this was we were bargaining away. Perhaps Mestea has more of Jil Sander’s knowledge than she admits to herself                                                                                    | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack once attempted a simile for Ooskar that went like this: If Ooskar could perform a thing which was undetectable by a mage spell of given power, how could he convince a mage limited to that spell power that the deed was done? This appeared to be related to Ooskar’s skepticism that our female companion is his sister.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Have no doubts, Marcellus; I have been convinced she is Mestea. Jil Sander was known to me, and Queen Sander is not a member of our hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ryndall immediately wished for my memories and skills to be restored to the state before the Dagger Lady attack. Mack produced a quill from his blouse and without dipping for ink, he wrote on one of his scrolls something like:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack wrote on the scroll: > ______ wish that all Mollon lost to the Dagger Ladies would be restored to him as if never lost, save for he will recall the incident as it happened to him. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack, in addition to supplying the exact words, hinted that in order to keep him happy, we would have to be happy. He also suggested that I could ask for my own wishes, and Ryndall could as for something more personally useful. At this time I was still guarding against him, and made no reply. There was much writing on the scroll which had not been explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I believe it was at this time that Mestea got that look in her eyes which we’ve all come to fear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ryndall then asked to be smarter about understanding the people around him: their motivations and such. Mack narrowed down Ryndall’s intentions like a gardener weeding a familiar garden. When Ryndall was satisfied with the wordplay, Mack produced a morsel of that southern treat, called cocoa, or choco, which Ryndall consumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack wrote on the scroll: > > Ryndall wishes he were smarter. > ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ryndall immediately said "I should have taken the money," which made your siblings and Crimson laugh, although the humor escaped me entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) During this exchange between Ryndall and Mack, your sister Mestea was constantly interjecting advice as well as comments less helpful. With one snide remark (which I missed) Mack pulled a brown smoking cigar from behind Mestea’s ear and gave it to her. I believe this trick was merely sleight-of-hand, and not spellcraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) After Ryndall had consumed his choco, Mestea approached Mack and demanded to hear the song of Avranaith once more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack initially appeared to think of her as Queen Sander, albeit with no deference at all, I must add. However, during Mack’s fencing and riposting to determine Mestea’s genuine wishes, he appeared to come swiftly to accept her as Mestea. Mack asked her three times in the clarification if Mestea wished to ungive the gift she had given to Jil Sander. Mestea did not think before answering **No** to the second and third instances of the question.                                                                                                                                                            |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) This was when Mack approached you, Marcellus. He stood by the disk you were resting on, and waved his hands over you as he once had to make a puppet of Ryndall. Ryndall or Mestea asked Mack if this was what he had done to Ryndall, but Mack did not appear to understand. They explained that Mack had shown the ability to force Ryndall to dance, and asked Mack if he could not just force us to sleep instead of make us sign contracts in blood.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) A discussion ensued about metaphysics: good guys and bad guys, and the mythical Blood and Dust, in which Mack believed enthusiastically. Mack claimed the lich you fought was trying to ally himself with Dust, and that Joree of the Flames was allied with Blood. Mack was certain that Blood was the good guys, and Dust was the bad guys. Mack eventually returned to near-reality saying we would be good guys if we signed these agreements in Blood.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) During this whole exchange your siblings appeared content to bargain, despite not knowing precisely what the promise was. I was strongly reminded of Fernan Solar’s tale of following you into doom at the hands of the Pellinese Tribe of the White Bird, trusting that you siblings had some plan or secret trick which was unseen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) At no time did Mack explain what we were agreeing to in a language any of us knew. Twice he rattled off a lengthy speech in some ancient language, but I could not even recognize the race or country of origin. Ryndall appeared to understand things better after he ate the choco, but at no time did Ryndall explain his knowledge to me better than to say we had to sleep for a day or two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack returned to your side, Marcellus, and reached into your shirt. There were gruesome wet sounds, as if a stick was poked about in a mud puddle, and as he fumbled beneath your blouse, Mestea was hardly able to contain herself. Presently Mack withdrew his hands, holding a white bone, which he claimed was your rib. there was no blood or stench of an open wound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mestea quipped something about the irony of being a rib, which none of us by Mack smiled at. Mack asked to borrow Ooskar’s glasses, and then waved his hands over Mestea, who immediately became a silvery mist. The sword Quizinart hovered within the mist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack began to mold your rib bone as if it was putty. He made it into a lumpy humanoid shape, and then enlarged it to human proportions. Ooskar studied the bone construct as if memorizing the motions performed by Mack. There was a conversation here, but the topics escape my memory. There was some exchange about the cost of the magic, perhaps even a referral about Nolerak’s reaction to Mack’s interference. I don’t recall exactly when Mack expressed some rue at his temerity.                                                                                                                              | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) When the rib was human size and shape, Mack asked Ooskar to hold it upright and commanded Mestea to move to surround the bone construct. She did. Mack waved his hands until she appeared as an elf once more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) As you can see, Mestea’s hair and skin are now the colors we all remember. Her face, although younger, still displays the features of Queen Sander. Expressing disappointment, Mestea once again was asked if she wanted to ungive her gift to the Queen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) When it was settled, Mack turned to Ooskar, but rather than listen to Ooskar’s lack of decisiveness be ridiculed by Ryndall, Mack quickly regarded Crimson Grey. Mestea and Ryndal had background chatter, pretending to know better than Crimson what was best for him, but did not defer when Crimson asked for knowledge of time and space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack appeared to wince and smile at the same time. He asked Crimson if he knew the legends of the Kingdom of Troad. When Crimson allowed that he had a certain familiarity with the legends, Mack told him that he was a member of that family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) After this, Mack called Crimson Grey "cos" perhaps three times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) We all turned to Ooskar then, in earnest. Ooskar apparently had been thinking, for he came to a decision in less than two hours. Ooskar wished to talk to and understand all creatures, as well as read and write all languages. Mack appeared to think this was two separate wishes, and a lengthy discussion ensued detailing that creatures were creatures and objects were not creatures, and creatures are not objects. Ooskar eventually picked creatures.                                                                                                                                                          |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I lifted my hand at this point, having changed my mind and not signed my contract yet. Mack asked me what I wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Mack immediately suggested that this wish may require effort on my part to sustain, and in my arrogance I simply nodded, and flushed with more excitement than good sense, I signed in my blood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I inferred that previously there was some unrest in Mack about the costs of fulfilling his agreements. He seemed to say that he would pay for his dealings with children of Nolerak in some manner of repayment directly to Nolerak. After we all signed our contracts, Mack gave to Ryndall two Larethian Mark Rings, holy artifacts containing the Will of Nolerak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I have seen these before in my life, but never held one or seen one used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ryndall gave one to the care of Mestea, and one into the care of me. Ryndall suggested that he had used such a ring to restore memories he had lost, in tandem with a Priest of another religion. Apparently my arrogance had not entirely passed, for as soon as Mack had departed, I used the Will of Nolerak so that you, Marcellus, would have the ability to restore me to the skills I lost to the Dagger Ladies.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) It is my hope you can do this thing, Marcellus. I have thought of a deed I must do to prevent a war with the Shanagates, and this deed requires a skill I have lost to the Black Daggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
