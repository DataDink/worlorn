>  Hello. 
>
>  I am Josie of Musquel-by-the-sea.  [ko](ko.md)  the Greater God of Improvement was my father, although I claim none of his power, only his hope for a better world. I need your help curing a problem with di Griz, who was to be the next Archmage of Roke.
>
>   I would like you to come to  [musquel](musquel.md)  and try to help me treat the madness that has come over my friend di Griz. He has removed all of his Hope outside his body, and placed it into a flameing [sic] beacon outside his hut here in the village. We don't think he's going to waken. 
>
>  Ever.
>
>  On All Hallows Eve di Griz was attacked by Seven out of eight Turf Holders for doing what he thought was right. He's refusing to live in a world which rejects him so harshly. I cannot find it in me to say he is wrong. But I find that I miss his presence deeply. I think we all will.
>
>  The fire grows so dim it's almost extinguished between adventures. It's as if he's afraid adventures will never happen again. If it goes out, he retires to the Mistress of Abandoned dreams.
>
>   What I need from you is to compose a speech, as long or as short as you like. This speech is to help return hope to di Griz' shattered spirit. Start your speech to di Griz with the phrase, "Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but..." 
>
>   Continue your speech with whatever you find sincerely true. Don't be afraid to say you didn't know what's going on. Do be certain to say why you think he should waken again. Tell him about what you think is wonderful about life and adventuring. No happiness is too small to mention.
>
>   Do not lie to fill speeches; he's got a bullshit detector good for miles. Remember, di Griz is the next Archmage. If he ever wakes up.
>
>   I suggest we all end our speeches with the Phrase, "Please wake up, di Griz. Worlorn needs your wisdom."
>
>   If you don't feel comfortable speaking with a stranger, I understand. I don't think he needs to know YOU, so much as to know WE NEED HIM to waken for this world to be a better place. But still, if you don't wish to speak to di Griz, do not do this. Silence is better than insincerity.
>
>   Thank you.

 Hello di Griz. 
>
>   I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I wasn't paying any attention to you.
>
>   I've spent so long watching you to see if you're right for Archmage, that I had to withdraw when I saw you act from impatience in Llewghund. You destroyed that woman's mind with your staff, when you knocked open her box. If Aleks had not wished, her mind would have been shredded when you broke it open without knowledge or care.
>
>   Here at Musquel you came to realize that everyone, even the non-dreamers, even the mundane citizens were important to their trusted leaders. Josie said you acted to save the villagers when Llyr threatened them. I know you blessed their sheep when you had business of your own. Josie told me how you came to learn what burden the Throne grants you. You did not shirk the burden of blessing the sheep of the ignorant.
>
>   This is the man I chose to succeed me at Roke. You were right. They were fools. But di Griz, the world is full of fools, and that's why we have to act.
>
>   Please wake up, di Griz. Worlorn needs your Wisdom.

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but the spirit of Shal-Omnis was there that night and in this, so was I. We have not always seen eye to eye as you have not shared my vision, but the world without you would certainly not be as fun. Roke needs your leadership ... I WISH your light would grow brighter than ever before ... life is too precious to sleep. Awaken di Griz of Fire and lend your wisdom to the world again. Without you, darkness will surely gain in power ... and that would not be good for anyone. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Di Griz...can you hear me? What has happened to you? No one will give me a straight answer. I was so grateful to you for your part in breaking Tann free from that Nasty Thing! I didn;t realize it neatly got you killed. You can;t stop now. You are supposed to be the next ArchMage. There is this horrible goadawful dreaming dragoin demon thing walking around, and I bet you, as the ArchMage would be in a lot better position to change this icky state of the universe than you are now...and I'll help. I have this nifty DemonChain that is just made for things like this. That hting has a lot of nerve, anyhow. It need to be stuck up on a shjelf in a nice blue glass bottle somewhere. And we better get it before it takes over anyone else we know and love, hey? Come out and play. Rememer when you were a little rat, riding the wind by hanging on to my fur? You can still do that, though we both have grown, some. I think life was more fun then, before all this responsibility stuff showed up. Come out and play! This world is less fun wihtout you. And what you helped make needs your guidance, your wisdom, your balance to keep it whole. It is, of course, your choice. i will not interfere with another being's free will if I can help it. But, we need you, we miss you. Worlorn needs your guidance and your wisdom. This poor ignorant wolf needs your knowledge to trap that dreaming dragon unleashed uponthe world. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hi. You don't knowme but I know of you. I share a Dream with Chrysofar. I hear you are trying to retire. I think that there are many who will miss you really badly if you do that. Will it help if I dance for you? I know a good one--it's called "Fire Leaping". First part of a really long dance. it might make this flame brighter. Come out and dance with me.... [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I had not been summoned. Don't let the bastards beat you down. Consolidate your power, then slay them all and take their lands. These are the things of adventures. All must operate in their own.....whats the word I'm looking for....? [second voice, speaks in grating sepetural tones] "Idiom, master?" Idiom, yes. There are always others who will support you and rise with you. I see unfortunate choices with the New Day, but all can be changed in time, and the game and anticipation is most of the pleasure. Eternal success is eternal boredom. Eternal challenge is what makes us better and interested in this. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I was a little bit busy. Let me know if you want the bastards that did this to you punished. I am always available for a small fee. By the way, we spoke once before about the phosgene gas of my companion, Dolarhyde. You are welcome to vacaton at my home where no one will bother you. You may feel right at home with my red dragon friends. Do not take your life of your own will. To strive is the goal. If you feel you have no friends and the world has turned against you, join my club. I suppose some of that comes from being a sarcastic, paranoid merciless killer, but dammit I have feelings too. Let us talk and try to make a better world for ALL. We could be friends de'Griz. I don't betray friends. Ask Hektor. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I think I was somewhere else. You have done a nice job in filling the position of the "Waldann help us" syndrome. I liked to do that, because I liked the new challenges and different people. All were my friends and I enjoyed helping others achieve their goals and making the campaign a better place for people to succeed. I didn't have many of my own goals, but I have some powerful friends now and I would help them as I would help you. I merely defended myself when attacked, but was fortunately successful in those endeavors. I hear you have been doing some good work and wish you to continue. I offer my aid and support. We are similar spirits and should not give up trying. Awaken and become whatever fate has in store for you. Enjoy the trip. If you want to talk to me further, let me know. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I was not allowed. If you want rejection, try being a cleric of my religion. Worlorn must be desperately trying to awaken you if she is releasing all who are bound. I don't know you and you probably don't know me. I only know that Worlorn is the place of great challenge and no one person will conquer and rule. Change is good. People rise and fall. Worlorn is like a great tree with many branches and leaves. The tree grows and branches fall, leaves fall and are replaced. Great winds and fires come and the tree can remain standing and alive. Grounded in earth, fire destroys to make room for new life, Water removes leaves and brtanches, Wind takes leaves and branches away, The Great Void is where we all go in the end. There is always a struggle for the sun and resources and that is what makes the game great. Your time has not come yet de'Griz. To give up living is to fail the rest of the tree which requires it's leaves and branches to live. Pretty Zen, huh. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but until recently i had been dead for eons, and no one allowed to know me again. Talk about being abandoned. I think the word was "expunged". Changes can be made and it is up to us to make those changes. Large changes are very risky and people don't always agree with our decisions. Just ask the one who expunged me. [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 "Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but...I was suffering the unending death of Morganti consumption. You have released me, I am very grateful. It is a new day, the sun shines, and the world beckons to be explored again. I am indebted to you, and you have my pledge of friendship. I was once the most dangerous being in singular combat on this or any other planet, with me at your side, I think we could accomplish whatever you might like to do. Hope is forever, come with me and we shall write history and make stories the like of which even the God's will envy. Please Di Griz, wake up and come find your smile once again." [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I am here now to tell of a story of another who was without hope. Once a lonely dragon-mistress came into Elfhome, she asked to speak to me. I obliged and she told me that she had been approached to kill me. This concerned me greatly, especially after she told me who she was. She then gave me the 30 pieces of silver she had been paid. Sometime later, I saw her again in my hotel, I approached her and presented her with a gift, it was a silver comb, this comb before you now, which was made from the same 30 pieces of silver, and I said 'take this as a token of my affection, and my gratitude for your selfless act.' She took the comb used it on her fine hair, returned it to me, and left. Quite some time later I heard she had fallen into a sea of chaos, and only through her unbelievable will was rescued. After the rescue, I gave her this comb, it restored her, because it reminded her of what she once was, of the hope of mankind, and of the generosity of friends. As part of the rescue, we used a token of summoning, this token, which she gave me when I presented her with that comb. She gave me this saying that I should use it whenever I might desperately need her. I could not see any more desperate time than then, and it seemed to help. I tell you all this because it was that bond of friendship which saved a soul which this world needed. It needed her fire, her will, and her wisdom. Without it, many difficult things could not have been done for that lady was like you a Roke Mage, it was Morgan Le' Fay. I am your friend, Di Griz, you have saved my life, I bore your blade for you at one time, were it within my power to use that weapon to draw you forth, I would, but that is not possible, instead I must ask what I asked of that lady, come forth O' Great Serpent, come back to me my friend, for I need your spirit, Your fire, and your wisdom. I pledge my bond to stand by you when next the Gods choose to abandon you to entropy. Come and see the joy that is the harmony of Elfhome Come and see the laughter of the formerly slain Elven children brought back by the will of Life. Come and drink a toast with me in Port Suame to the Beauty of Aliera and all other wonderful maidens of the spring. Come back to me my friend, please, I want to share your humor, and Worlorn needs your wisdom." [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but...I had been put in da' groun cause I was sooo old. Nice to be back, I am going to go find some fish, and make a really neet dinner. I think Ill give it to doze 'Artificial Grass' guys, should be lots of fun. I think you would like to see them squirm as all thier stuff becomes mine cause da fishes can do anything (he, he) Come on' Ill bet we can get this done easier than bakin up a batch o jelly doughnuts. I understand yuze a wise guy, so some fella Warlord needs you to help him too...maybe he would like some fish." [*  [top](#top)  *]

 Lord diGriz, I do not know why the slumber of a creature of Fire has awakened A creature of water such as myself. I have heard that you are very wise. It is my goal and occupation to become wise. I can not Speak your wisdom. So I will sing you a song of my heart at this moment. it is metaphorical not literal. Last thing I remember I was standing on a hill shaking out my long dark hair Hm mm mm hm I hear the cry of an angel climing through the trees I made my way to the source but It was gone Now here I am I don't recognize this village where everythings is stone and sand and where are all the trees I don't think I can live in this Wrong century ahh Get me out of here Take me to my homeland Get me out of here I miss my hill I will not leave in Fear of self destruct I am a peaceful man I don't think I can understand this Please wake up diGriz There is a need for wisdom. [*  [top](#top)  *]

 "Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but you were operating _way_ out of my league. I'm just a storyteller, when it comes right down to it. Saving the world gives me a queazy feeling. "I'll tell you, though, you sure gave me a lot to watch and admire. I'll be telling my children and the history books about the adventures we shared. Remember when you asked the Tree of Knowledge if I was going to get laid? Hah! If you ask me, no one has ever used it for a better or higher purpose! :-) "But I also remember our favorite Kav Elfar Swordsman, who only wanted to journey with you. It meant everything to him, yet he wouldn't push his agenda until you were ready. I miss him. "I also remember when you faced down the gods and goddesses of two coven after I'd been a stupid jerk. I haven't fogotten what I owe you. I remember how you stood up for me without laying blame after I'd screwed up big time in Carsultyl. I'm not proud about running off to avoid their revenge, but I heard how you stayed behind to mend the situation and look after the Big Picture. "Please wake up, di Griz. Worlorn needs your wisdom." [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 "Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but there were Iakhlu on both sides, which put me in a tough spot as Benevolent DM. You have tremendous potential, young one. You have asked questions never asked before. You have begun to perceive at a level never before imagined, and I see why the Archmage chose you as his Apprentice. Who has the vision to replace yours? Worlorn may not last forever, and so seldom does one come along to take the next step toward Understanding, and so many are those who only see what is in front of them. You are His hope as well. Please wake up, di Griz. Worlorn needs your wisdom." [*  [top](#top)  *] 
### 

 "Hello di Griz. I guess we let you down. I'm sorry I could not stand by you on All Hallow's Eve, but I feared you were about to make a mistake you would have come to regret. Long ago, when I experienced my first free Sentient, and seeing in it a Second Demonlord, I killed it. I killed it because I feared it. I killed it in haste, avoiding any conversation or contact, fearing that it would not seem terrible or dangerous, fearing that it would beg for its life, fearing that it would call me Murderer. It has been a long time since then. You have begun to show me that the universe is much larget than I knew. Where there was once one Sentient, then two, now we perceive more than twenty. I have spoken to one, and heard her tell me of her hopes and fears. She was of a higher order than I, but I recognized Her as a Person. No more than with Iakhlu should they be painted with a single brush. You and She taught me this. When you drew your Sword, I felt that you might do in anger what I had once done in fear. It pained me to act agains you, but I had to preserve Life: both yours and Hers. You have told me only a little of what you have glimpsed of matters at this high level. But if I may be so bold, it appeared to me that you did not know as much about the ramifications of action as you did about inaction. From the little I know of Roke Mages, I felt that you might have come to regret action under such a circumstance. But that is the past. I will accept your charge of cowardice and am content to live under your curse. We still need you, diGriz. This is a different world than we have lived in before. We old ones have perhaps grown too inflexible, reacting to new times in old ways. Tanngrisner is young and strong, as are Blacksword and Chrysofar. They will need your help to see the new world and its possibilities. Even since you began your sleep, new things beyond our imagination have arisen. Who is better qualified than you to help this young world be born? But there is more than that. I do not have, nor do I ever expect to have your deep insights into the truer nature of the universe. But I believe I have seen part of Troy's original Plan for us, as I said in my Prayer. You have created, and I pray will create in the future, some of the best Moments. We would all be the poorer for your loss. Please wake up, di Griz. Worlorn needs your wisdom." [*  [top](#top)  *]

 *"Awaiting the moon; meanwhile the fire, this moment, is glowing with hues.* "I am Colbart. Morgan la Faye and myself -- we are among the few who have stared down into the empty Abyss and can tell the tale. Each of us found our own way to stave off that beckoning Emptiness, to hold it at bay just one more moment, moment after moment (those infinite moments), and remain Ourselves. You may ask Morgan how she did it; I will not willingly say more of my experience. "They say you have lost hope. They say you have put your hope outside yourself into this flame. They say they fear your hope may die. In legend, there once was a queen, who in her moment of greatest despair said, "There's everything in life, except hope." Her king took her by the hands and replied, "We're alive. And for all I know, that's what hope is." "I am Colbart. I am the Flames of Old Troad. I am the Flames of the Courts of Chaos. I am the Flames of Crosstime. I am the Flames of Hell, and I am Alive. I say, ignore these fools who beg and plead with you. Face your emptiness, face your fears, moment after moment until you are damned good and ready to return. Sleep your sleep and rest from your labors until you are refreshed. My Flames will keep yours strong and burning brightly until that day -- and who will gainsay _me_?" [*  [top](#top)  *]

 Hello diGriz, I guess we let you down. I am sorry that I couldn't stand by you on All Hallow Eve. It seems I was caught up moving through time and space again as when I started being in octagons after I had grown up and been trained in Two Rivers. I have heard that you are wise and that your friends stood against you on all hallows eve. Perhaps they did not know the advantages of your wisdom. Perhaps they where afraid to follow you. I will pray to The Goddess Mars that You will know the advantage of waking and that you will conquer your sleep. I will pray that Lomion and his brother will break the swords of you enemies and lead you to victory. I will pray that I be guided as to knowing the cause I have been awakened to assist. Please Wake up diGriz. Worlorn needs wisdom. [*  [top](#top)  *]

 Hello diGriz, i guess we let you down. I'm sorry I couldn't stand by you on all hollows eve i was asleep. I was asleep on the ground. I'm a dryad. I had been alseep in Donerbaum in the heart of Karli. Somebody stole my home. I have to find a new home now. There aren't even any trees here. and the colors are awful. There are some attractive singers though. too bad that one threw himself in your sparks. they say you are wise but you need to change the colors of your sparks. they could be more alluring. Right now all they do is comfort there are so much more that sparks can do. Change the colours and you could make them weep, make them dance, eat, shiver, vomit, die, jump, sweat, love, make them move. I want my home back. I will dress myself in colours of homelessness and yearning. Please wake diGriz. Worlorn needs your wisdom. [*  [top](#top)  *]

 Hello diGriz, I guess we let you down. I'm sorry that I wasn't there to stand by you on all hallows eve. I understand what an extreme challange it is to try and reach a goal crossing-in-the-mist on all hallows eve.I also have tried and failed. I am not an historian but I do believe that no one has set a goal crossing-in-the-mist on that night and achieved it, ever. I would protect you from the pain of it, but, I know not if my pain is like unto your pain. Please wake up diGriz. Worlorn needs your wisdom. [*  [top](#top)  *]

 Hello diGriz. Looks like the world let you down. sorry _I_ couldn't stand with you. So your sleeping, good for you, It is a selfish move and I approve of selfishness. So go ahead and sleep. sleep while the Reeper takes the paths of the dead over Yama. Sleep while Blood finishes her move on the isle of time. Sleep while Llewghund moves to first among the turfs. Sleep, let the quaking world rock you in your slumber, like a child. Sleep. and Know that if any harm comes to me or mine because the beloved of roke would not wake, the gith will be dispatched and Your Wisdom passed to a more deserving other, by my hand! Awake diGriz or a Worlorn in need will have your Wisdom. [*  [top](#top)  *]
