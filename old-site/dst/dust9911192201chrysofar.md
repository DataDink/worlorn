Hey, I did! Is it MY fault someone else has the fucking gold card for
stars, huh??? You forgot to tell me about that one!
So what was I supposed to do? Let those Blood morons get the best of me?!
Sorry about your favorite toys! So remake them already and I won't re-dust
them! Sheeesh! You pout worse than a two year old!
