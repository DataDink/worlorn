 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The weirmoniken Mage Brandon Talaar Stardust started his own wizard academy as soon as he discovered Necrodemus' required pledge to use the Imperial Orb. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Rumors say Tellaar was a Dark Angel pledged to Salt Peter, who supplied the required secrets to break through the Pomerium. It is known that Salt Peter was a Telaarian instructor in the times after the passing of Necrodemus I.
