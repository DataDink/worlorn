# old friends, new enemies



 fate decided by conversations of the powerful

[tanrisong01](tanrisong01.md) 





  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A chance exists that Tanri stands at the rail where the grand staircase of Salt Peter’s Estate rises above the main entrance hall. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  She looks down upon the open foyer to see the Prince of Wallachia striding across the tiled floor. Uncharacteristically,  [petros](petros.md)  is walking swiftly to keep up with an elfar; normally companions of the prince stride to match his pace. Both men wear black, from boot to gloves, with only their heads exposed. Tanri thinks she has seen this elfar companion before, perhaps in a dream. His black is the dress uniform of a  [n_darkangel](n_darkangel.md) . 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja’s butler Anton appears inside the front door. He is a dark haired Khansman, perhaps thirty. Perhaps he was always there, but Vlad and his companion stop and spin, making flat knives of their hands and freezing in battle stances, as if they both were surprised to see Anton appear. At this time the Dark Angel notes Tanri’s presence. The Wallachians relax and adjust their formal clothing. Their eyes meet. The Dark Angel says, "Alfred," and they share a smile. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Oblivious, with back to the Wallachians, Anton places both hands on the heavy brass knockers. He waits to open the twin doors until the sound of a knock fills the entrance hall and fades completely. The butler Anton opens both doors and regards the visitor. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The visitor is human, tall and thin and ancient. He must be over forty, perhaps fifty, or more. His hair is cropped military short, almost as short as Petros’, and is peppered with as much grey. The men would be age-mates. The newcomer wears the black and grey uniform of the occupying armies, the officer-priests of the Deathgod. He displays many colorful insignias and awards on the left breast of his jacket. He is alone. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Grand Moff Tarkin to see the singer." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Yes sir," says Anton. "The singer?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Vlad Petros steps forward, his Dark Angel working hard to stay between the Prince and the Grand Moff without blocking the view of either. "Anton, we will guide the Grand Moff to the sitting room if you will locate  [maja](maja.md) ." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Anton does not hesitate. "Yes, my Prince." Anton walks to the stair and ascends, passing Tanri with a respectful nod and smile. None of the men below glance upwards. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "What singer are you referring to?" asks Petros. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "A good day to you, Lord Drakulya. How is the state of Wallachia on this fine morning?" Tarkin’s booming false cheer fills the room. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We have taken it back from the occupying force, of course. It appears Illithids are as squeamish about the  [morganti](morganti.md)  as are your priests of  [yama](yama.md) ." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The top of the steps is far enough away, out of range, so that Tanri’s ears ring, but she is not deafened or slain by hearing the evil name. Vlad Drakulya spits out a fly from his mouth as he says the god’s name, but otherwise appears unbothered. The Death Priest Tarkin is of course not affected by an Unholy Word from his own deity. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  However, Petros’ Dark Angel blinks rapidly and sways on his feet and holds out his arms slightly, as if dizzy from a great blow to the head. The Dark Angel glares at his lord, a glare that Tanri recognizes instantly. This is the Dark Angel that she disarmed and captured! (*Alone? Was there another helper or was that a dream?*) The assassin now looks even more angry than when Tanri held him helpless in that grassy field. Vlad Petros dismisses his Dark Angel with a second gesture after the first produces only heightened irritation. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Grand Moff smiles. "Threats, and displays of power, so early in the morning?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Vlad Petros shrugs. "You must not have heard news of your forces deployed to occupy Wallachia. Do not wait for their souls to appear in the  [dryland](dryland.md) , Grand Moff. It is no longer possible. Maarter Phaal was decades unfed. Your soldiers no longer participate in the  [mortalcoil](mortalcoil.md) ." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tarkin regards Petros in silence. He says, "You are beyond evil." Petros bows. Tarkin continues, "How did the Illithids deploy effectively against Wallachian Land Law?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "I should tell you their strategy?" Vlad cups an elbow in his palm, and places the other hand under his chin, gazing towards the ceiling, seeing Tanri for the first time. After meeting her eyes, Petros ignores Tanri entirely. "I do believe that no chance exists." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "You can satisfy my curiosity." Tarkin says jovially. "For old times’ sake." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Petros smiles a tight smile. "For old times’ sake? Very well then. Let us finish with old loyalties now." Tarkin appears mildly confused. "The monsters had inspired help." says Petros. Tarkin raises both eyebrows. Petros continues. "Family help." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "A Kin of Troy aiding Illithids against the family?" Tarkin is incredulous. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "It is not the first time. However, for this woman, it was her first and last time." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "A woman? You fed her to the morganti too?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "I may be impatient and direct, but I am not stupid. No Kin will come to Wallachia to punish me for using Maarter Phaal on family. A Truthsay verified my cousin was aiding Illithids against Imperial Wallachia, against my city and holdings at Tirgoviste, as well as aiding her to satisfy a grudge against me personally. She is now disabled, incarcerated and undergoing further interrogations." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Interrogations? Is the Necrodemian Morganti Interdict against rape still active?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Why are you here, Tarkin?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Why are you here, Petros?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Maja and  [sharra](sharra.md)  invited the other  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  bearers here to discuss how we will punish you personally. I wanted to **Transform** you into something petty and small and kind of heart, but the others wanted a change. Sharra of course wants you **Destroyed**.  [abelard](abelard.md)  wanted to **Protect** you in a permanent retirement community, but the honored Lord Heron insists that you should be **Unmade**, with all memories of you lost even to your god." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "How dare you!" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "We are *not* joking!" The men stand too close. Petros steps closer still, chest to chest with Tarkin. "You act against the Empire you vowed to uphold, Grand Moff! You are a traitor." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tarkin smiles as if waiting for this moment. "The Armies of Death and the Grey Lord act under the authority of Necrodemus I, following orders from his appointed sovereign, Machiavelli of Florence. You of all people cannot reproach me, Lord Drakulya. Your grandfather Vlad Tepes held Necrodemus himself accountable when the Emperor failed to uphold his own laws. We are doing the same for his absent heir." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Necrodemus I is dead. You are a traitor to his heir." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "The heir has forsaken our Empire, We cannot allow one man’s absence to damage the legacy of Necrodemus. Let the High One come forth and accuse us of treason." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The men stand silent. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "As Prince of Wallachia, I am within my rights to accuse in his stead." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Rights! What are you going to do Petros? Ask a Truthsay who is correct?" Tarkin laughs, a short bark that echoes throughout the tiled hall. Petros’ whisper is almost lost in the echoes. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "You will remove the Death Star back to its berth in Terra Mortae, or you shall see what I will do, Tarkin. *You will retreat in your moment of triumph!* If the next  [redlight](redlight.md)  casts a shadow of your Death Star anywhere but Terra Mortae, no one, not me, not the High One, not even your god, will know you ever existed." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tarkin has nothing for Petros but the rage in his eyes. He turns abruptly and opens the doors, departs. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Petros stands where he was. His gloved fists clench and unclench. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja comes up behind Tanri, smiles and descends to stand near Vlad Petros. "You frightened off my guest? Shame on you! Was it really the Grand Moff? I so much wanted to see him." Vlad can nod, but apparently not speak. Even from this distance, Tanri can see Petros shivering, as if cold. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja steps to him and puts her hands on his shoulders. She starts to rub with stiff fingers, digging them into his leathers. "I didn’t even know you were here. Wallachia is retaken? Of course it is. Does Sharra know?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "No one knows I’m here" Petros says, "We’ve not been here an hour. Dokken and I were on our way to Junior’s kitchen when Tarkin paid a call. He says he’s withdrawing the Death Star immediately." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja looks up stairs at Tanri, and smiles. Vlad Petros follows her glance, but he is not smiling. "Is that the singer?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja nods and says, "Haven’t you met Tanri? Tanri Silverharp sang a special song for the Grand Moff while you were away. From what Sharra says we may have empowered it sufficiently to force Tarkin to leave only on its merits." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "A song did all that? Then I am pleased to meet you Tanri," calls the Prince of Wallachia. "I invite you to sing for me officially some time." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  
  "It would be my honor, Lord Drakulya," responds Tanri, with a courtly bow. "Please forgive me for eavesdropping on your conversation," she continues, starting down the stairs. "As the visitor named me when he entered, I assumed the conversation would involve me. I appear to have been wrong. Please name the level of secrecy you wish for that conversation, and I will hold to it." 

 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Pray do not keep secrets on my account." Petros smiles an evil smile, displaying no teeth. "Perhaps the lich feels differently, but I have nothing to fear if our little chat comes to light." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Despite the words, Petros suddenly appears gravely concerned, extends a gloved hand towards Tanri. "However, as the Grand Moff came to speak with "the singer" and not the Prince of Wallachia, it is for me to apologize and offer reparation. I hope you are not insulted. How may I make amends?" 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "In my anger I thoughtlessly interrupted what maybe your only opportunity to deal with the Necrodemian Grand Moff. I know there are citizens all over the empire who would die to see Governor Tarkin." Vlad Petros's face is placid, but a tight smile curves his lips. "We may never learn Tarkin's purpose for visiting, for a chance exists that now that the lich will never remember his intentions at all." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  
  Tanri reaches the bottom of the stairs, and stands facing him, calm and poised. Then she breaks into a grin. "[Then] I should thank you, for inadvertently turning his attention away from me. I'm not sure I want to know what that gentleman wanted with me, or how much he knows about what I have done." 

 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Petros bows his head, clicking the heels of his boots together. His icy blue eyes meet Tanri's' with surprising force. "None-the-less, I wronged you, to your good fortune or no." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja softly touches the small of Tanri's back with her finger, saying "Tanri Silverharp does not dismiss your offer to make amends, Lord Drakulya. She will honor your honor when it is appropriate." Petros holds Tanri's gaze a moment, then bows his head, once to Tanri, then again to Maja, who blinks with surprise. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  
  Tanri turns to Maja. "I don't know if Anton told you, but he originally asked for "the singer" when he arrived." 

 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja nods. "I admit surprise to see that the Moff had not accosted you, since he came here with that intent." She turns to Petros. "What did you say that would make a politician leave rudely without seeing his hostess? I didn't think Tanri's song would leave conscious resentment or anger." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  
  Tanri's features cloud a bit. "And Maja, I fear you give me too much credit. My spell was only to prevent him from opposing your church. You said you did not care who walked the streets in this city, so I did not weave his departure, specifically. If he finds himself powerless to act, and would not stay for any other reason, then he will leave. If he takes Lord Drakulya at all seriously," a nod to the man next to her, "then he will leave quickly. But my magic will not impel him on its own. I did not know that you wanted that. I'm sorry." 

 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja forces a self conscious laugh, and looks sideways at Petros. "Then we were unfortunately unclear in our haste. We wove a departure into your song. Sharra and I cast enchantments to carry on your pervasive voice and music." Maja's face grows pink, but she seems to be more worried about Petros' reaction than Tanri's. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "Within my radius, the words of your song carried my Water powers to Remove the Death Star from Port Suame, and within my radius I enabled Sharra to Destroy Tarkin's morale with the fires of your convictions." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Petros smiles briefly at Maja, here and gone, before he turns impassively to Tanri. "I was so certain that I was lying to Tarkin." 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Maja glances back and forth between her guests. Petros responds only by offering upturned eyebrows towards Tanri.
