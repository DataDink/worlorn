# almitra almustafa



The Summoner,  [patternfall2](patternfall2.md)

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **Almitra** appears as a caucasian female with jet black hair and electric blue eyes. She stands a slim 5’ 4”, but with attitude. She rules  [llewghund](llewghund.md)  proximately, often allowing dreamers to summon her attention or avatar. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  For someone with the will to freeze flux into irridisium (or anything else she whims) she comes across as light hearted and capricious. Her wide ranging interests are evidenced throughout Llewghund as well as in her personal fashion statements. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Almitra is said to have seduced the Phoenix ” [threnody](threnody.md) ” to obtain  [lightworld](lightworld.md) . She is said to have seduced the  [Dreams](Dreams.md)  of  [troy](troy.md) ,  [halfelven](halfelven.md) , to father her second son,  [simon](simon.md) . She is said to have seduced the Great Mage Salt Peter into sharing his place of Power, Port Suame, for Simon to inherit. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is said that Almitra turned an invited guest to Llewghund, the Worlorn  [sheherezade](sheherezade.md) , to **Blood**. However, from all accounts of the great bard Halifirien Wedge, Almitra is a most welcoming and attentive hostess to Inspired guests.
