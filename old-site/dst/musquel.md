Marlee asks

WAS Musquel Ko's Turf when He was destroyed by fire there?
Yes. It was Turf until the Ko body died.

Why did Sethra have to remove Ko from her Game plan?
Not have to. Because he was there. Because she could.

IS there any old Gods on the Wasteland?
Not unless you count Threnody, Naminanu, Damon Eternal, Ozzy Fudd, Morte,
etc. Ddefine old god. Is the Half-elven one an old god or is Oberon? Piscator or
Ko?

Will the Sherjashub of Ko come from the Dung pits?
No. Sethra lied; when a creature is de-throned by a Sword of the Wasteland,
there is no reminant to come from the Dung pits. She must have had another
Ace in the Hole. Maybe that's why she kept Hannibal Lecter around.

 What could be done for the Sherjashub of KO (if anything) 
 to help it regain its former perspective? 
If one had remained, he/she/it may have assumed a majority of Ko's power via
ingesting the ash and phlogisten gas produced at Ko's demise.

Hey Marlee, who trahsed Musquol? Do you know?

Solitude stands by the window 
she turns her head as I walk in the room
i can see by her eyes she's been waiting 
Standing in the slant of the late afternoon
And she turns to me with her hand extended
Her palm is split with a flower with a flame
Solitude stands in the doorway
And I'm struck once again by her black silouette
By her long cool stare and her silence
I suddenly remember each time we've met.
And she turns to me with her hand extended
Her palm is split with a flower with a flame
And she says "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"
And she says "I've come to lighten this dark heart"
And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear
And I say "I never thought of finding you here"
I turn to the crowd as they'er watching
They'er sitting all together in the dark in the warm
I wanted to me in there among them 
I see how their eyes are gathered into one
And then She turns to me with her hand extended 
Her palm is split with a flower with a flame
And she says "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"
And she says "I've come to lighten this dark heart"
And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear
And I say "I never thought of finding you here"

Hey Marlee, who trahsed Musquol? Do you know?

 Oh thou, Who givest Sustanence to teh Universe
 From whom all things Proceed
 To whom all things return
 Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun
 Hidden by a disc of golden light
 That we may know the truth
 And do our whole duty
 As we journey to they sacred feet
Well I said
"Lily, Oh Lily I don't feel safe
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me"
And she said
"Child child you must Protect yourself 
I'll show you how with Fire"
 Gabriel Before me
 Raphael behind me
 Michael to my right
 Uriel to my left side
 In the Circle of Fire
I said
"Lily, Oh Lily I'm so afraid
I fear I walk in the Veil of Darkness"
And She said
"Child, take what I say
With a pinch of salt
And Protect yourself with Fire"
 Gabriel Before me
 Raphael behind me
 Michael to my right
 Uriel to my left side
 In the Circle of Fire

Hey Marlee, who trahsed Musquol? Do you know?

"Fire on the mountains lighting in the air! Go to them hills Boy and Wait for
me there."

{she shakes her head in teh affirmative}

Suspect? . . Remo ?
{She shakes her head no}
