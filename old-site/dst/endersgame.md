# ender’s game



 playing the game of blood and dust

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Legends exist of a  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  known as **Ender’s Game**, said to both *display* and *deploy* the moves of  [game](game.md)  of Blood and Dust. 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is said by those who have seen the physical form that Ender's Game is a chess set with pieces of deadly sharp crystal in Red and White, as well as a complete Yellow team of Faerie pieces. Many pieces bear the resemblance of personalities well-known in Worlorn during the Cycle of Dreams.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  It is odd that no student named  [ender](ender.md)  Wiggin is recorded as attending the  [roke](roke.md)  School, let alone attaining the rank of Mage. However, it was near the time that Ender’s alleged Great Work appeared that Roke stopped teaching non-human students due to a decree by the current Archmage of Roke, whose name is also unrecorded.
