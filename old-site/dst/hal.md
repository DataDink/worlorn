|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Hallenrakenthaller, onetime [archmage](archmage.md) of [roke](roke.md) and first Games Authority of [troad](troad.md) , I have transcribed his suicide note. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The method of transmision was a wooden rod, delivered by Voler messenger. When the intended recipient touches the rod in an otherwise silent room, a Magic Mouth spell is triggered to speak Hal’s last message. For a decade, the rod has never failed to speak in this manner; it appears a Power of Permanency was used. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Three message rods are known to exist. One was delivered to [eressea](eressea.md) , one to [traveller](traveller.md) high-Ironjade X, and one to Hektor Protector. Each of these persons is addressed directly within the spoken message, and no other. It may be noted that the latter two were given tasks to perform, while Hal was visiting my Lady [eressea](eressea.md) when he took his life on his [morganti](morganti.md) vorpal [greatweapons](greatweapons.md) Named Lifesbane. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Hal’s message is spoken in an eerie monotone, devoid of emotion or normal intonation present in the recipient’s native tongue. Perforce, I have taken some liberties transcribing certain sounds and utterances, most specifically into laughter some utterances that are not humorous. Paragraph breaks occur when context or an educated guess indicate when Hal’s mind wandered to another thought. In all cases, I have tried to make conservative choices in transcribing this message to paper. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Thanks to my beloved [eressea](eressea.md) , who triggered the voice many times for my edification, despite the unpleasant nature of the task. Vladimir Tollenkov, Lord Dolbadarn  |

|  April is the cruelest month, Breeding lilacs out of the dead land, Mixing memory and desire.  |  Hal quotes from [wasteland](wasteland.md) .  | 
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) What do I desire? Weillala, Weillala! I want to rest. I want to sleep without dreams. I have dreams. They come to me and I see them writhe.  |  Weillala is an exclamation from [wasteland](wasteland.md) .  | 
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | 

|  Beyond the river of the blest. There we sat down. Yea, we wept, when we remembered [troy](troy.md) . Our swords were shattered in our hands and we hung our shields on the oak tree. The silver towers were fallen into a sea of blood. How many miles to [troy](troy.md) ? None, I say, and all: the silver towers are fallen.  |   | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Hello. Much as I would like to be with you today, I am forced to be elsewhere on business Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! My nerves are bad tonight.  |   | 
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The [morganti](morganti.md) weapons have been almost totally Destroyed. There are only a few left. If I remember, I shall tell you their names. They cannot be Destroyed. They cannot be Destroyed. Cannot be tried for the same crime twice. Oh, Isis! They are immune to Fire!  |  At the time Maeglinti weapons were still called [morganti](morganti.md) . Hal refers to [digriz](digriz.md) ’ incompetent effort to Destroy the 666 Maeglinti weapons.  | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  Maeglin is dead on his last blade. I will soon join him. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I, I, I, I was only trying to help. I, I, I was only to do what I thought was right. I was only...  |  Maeglinti blade 666 was called the Ragger.  | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) He is dead. He is really dead: [troy](troy.md) Ounces, Magic User Extraordinaire. The first and the mighty is no more. We have killed him. He said, "Mary Mary, Hold on tight!" Ha-ha! ha-ha! He was alone, so alone, and he was scared at the end. I saw his hands His hands shook from fear. We did nothing. None of us did anything. His hands were shaking. Piss on the good of the many. I saw his hands. Even his own sons, Even his own family stood by. We stood by and watched, we stood by and did nothing. When we could have made the difference, When we could have given him the chance he had given us A nightmare would be no worse would it?  |  When the illithids attacked [troy](troy.md) Ounces, no creature came to his aid. The details of the attack come to Hal through his illithid memories.  | 
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) And what was done to him! What could have been worse than what was done? They took his brains, [eressea](eressea.md) ! They took his head and broke him open so they could feast. They took his very flesh, blood of our own veins, and made meat of him. He was divided seven by seven and consumed. He was their food.  |  The 49 illithids divided [troy](troy.md) ’s grey matter evenly amongst themselves for a meal. The sum 49 implies that the [deathgod](deathgod.md) [yama](yama.md) , his son [kalkin](kalkin.md) the binder, and the Dark Angel Syrinara also fed, for each of these beings had previously slain an illithid and placed its skull in his or her head.  | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I, I, I, I want to rest without dreams. Oh, [troy](troy.md) ! And I was one of them! I was eating, I was there eating at their sides! I remember his flesh on my own mouth, standing with his mind in my own hands and wiped the blood, grinning, from my mouth. I was not one of them. I was not there. I stood by and watched, I was not there. You must believe me in this thing. I was not one of them, then. I would never help them kill [troy](troy.md) .  |  [threnody](threnody.md) and I agree this is Hal’s memory merging with that of the illithid whose skull Hal implanted. Hal’s personality obviously maintains enough dominance to display remorse and pride.  | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  What they did was unspeakable. The [pattern](pattern.md) , The Chamber of the [pattern](pattern.md) , Troy's mind, Troy's blood, What they did with it. I could not stand it. I could not stay. I had to leave. The room of the [pattern](pattern.md) . My own mind wouldn't have been able to stand it. Do not go there, [traveller](traveller.md) . No matter what you think. You do not understand. You must not go there my *teyn*. Do not send any of the family to the [pattern](pattern.md) . You must believe me in this thing.  |  [threnody](threnody.md) and I visited the Chamber of the [pattern](pattern.md) and found Puk there, transfixed by the carnage, unable to process the vision of [troy](troy.md) ’s entrails disbursed with precision about the chamber. A dozen Kin beheld the slaughter and became permanently deranged before the chambers were sealed.  |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I have a dream who is cruel but kind. My shining star, Star has gone home. Star has gone away. Star gave me these numbers Here are the numbers, Give them to [nemesis](nemesis.md) :  |  A weirmoniken female Paladin named Star shared Hal’s Dreams. A priest named [nemesis](nemesis.md) tracks the Maeglinti weapons.  | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) 546, 521, 510, 531, 532, 533, 534, 519, 527, 526, 525, 544, 512, 513, 514, 545, 540, 538 through 540, 537, also 590 through 592, 588, 589, 551, 552, 557, 558, 523. did you get those numbers? All the rest are before 110. There are no more but these that I give you that are above 110. I only came later.  |  These appear to be Maeglinti weapon numbers between 1 and 666 which were too powerful for [digriz](digriz.md) to Destroy.  |

|  They killed Barney. They killed him. He would have been so harmless as [dira](dira.md) . He would have been funny. He would have been. Barney is dead. When their lord was annihilated they had no longer any check. They had no longer any reason to fear. They had no reason to stand by. They killed Barney. It was the horse, The Dark Horse. If only it had been Typhon. If only there had been a chance. The horse became king and they followed him to the Muse of Dreams. They followed him to the [muses](muses.md) and that was the beginning. The mind flayers found Stilgar and Duncan and even the Gith were not able to help. The Gith were not able to help.  |  Barney, the party-play Mind Flayer was an iahklu illithid that had triggered a helm of opposite alignment. As an iahklu, Barney intimidated the 49 and saved all iahklu from coming to harm at the tentacles of illithids for the second half of the [dreams](dreams.md) . Crossing-in-the-Mist at the [northpole](northpole.md) Barney was apparently slain while assimilating [dira](dira.md) ’s powers. An unspecified illithid, masquerading as an nightmare warhorse to the Faerie crusader Estrille Meistar, was brought by Estrille to the [lakedreams](lakedreams.md) . Stilgar and Duncan Idaho were iahklu who had stopped Crossing-in-the-mist there, and never Dreamed again. During the attack, the Gith were overwhelmed. Some years later it was proven that their [hermione](hermione.md) had one of Hal’s 15 skulls implanted in her head, where it remains to this date. [threnody](threnody.md) suspects that this is why no new iakhlu are inspired to Cross-in-the-mist; all newly inspired iahklu are consumed at inception by the illithid who is [hermione](hermione.md) of the [lakedreams](lakedreams.md) .  | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) [troy](troy.md) , oh [troy](troy.md) ! [troy](troy.md) , how did we fail thee? We tried so hard. ug, ug, ug, ug! Ug, we tried so hard. Hard, hard, hard. We failed so hard. [troy](troy.md) , we only wanted to help.  |   | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) [troy](troy.md) tried to get the statue. They fell upon him. He went to [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) . He went to [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) . He didn’t go to [troad](troad.md) . He went to [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) . If only he had known. If only he had not gone there.  |  Hal appears to suggest that he knew fleeing to [troad](troad.md) would have been somehow better for [troy](troy.md) than fleeing to [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) was.  | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) They ate him. I see him falling and his head opening. And even yet my mouth waters at the sight of his brains. Don't use the skulls. They aren't for us. The skulls must not be used. Kill Yama and [kalkin](kalkin.md) before they learn. Kill Them. Use Greyswandir. Ask [almitra](almitra.md) . Ask [almitra](almitra.md) ; she knows about Greyswandir. Ask [ko](ko.md) . Ko knows about [almitra](almitra.md) and the sword.  |  The Deathgod [yama](yama.md) and his son K were the first two slayers of illithids in historical record. Each placed the jade skull of his victim in his head, and thereby gained illithid psionic abilities and Probability controls despite not being of the Trojan bloodline. Legend has it that a wager between Benedict and [erin](erin.md) the Betrayer brought the Deathgod low, rather than interference by [almitra](almitra.md) and Ko. However, Halifirien [wedge](wedge.md) and [threnody](threnody.md) collected evidence that Ko was present and aware when a Wrathman slew [yama](yama.md) in the [paths](paths.md) with the Crosstime weapon Greyswandir.  |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ask them. Ask them about the son of man. Ask them. Who was the son of [troy](troy.md) and who was the son of man. Ask [almitra](almitra.md) about her first Dream. Her son is the one. Her son might save us all. Teach him how to draw. Remember how to draw, Hector? Teach him how to draw. He may save us all. Morningstar might know. Oh, Isis! I forgot to say goodbye to Morningstar.  |  The son of [almitra](almitra.md) is a Roke-trained Dreamer named [simon](simon.md) . Evidence suggests he is the Emperor of Lartroxia, Necrodemus VII. Hal obviously appeals to Hektor to teach [simon](simon.md) how to draw [trump](trump.md) , or perhaps a new [pattern](pattern.md) . However, in my timeline, [simon](simon.md) is responsible for [patternfall](patternfall.md) , not the rise of a [pattern-he](pattern-he.md) . Morningstar is an Titan-like [asteroid](asteroid.md) Power, cursed to remain on a certain mountain peak while Red Light obscures true dawn in [troad](troad.md) .  | 
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) We knew it would happen. And we planned.  |  The voice does not clarify if this "we" refers to Morningstar or [remo](remo.md) .  | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I waited until they were deep into the spice. I waited until they were into the visions, the premonitions, the spice. Oh, [troy](troy.md) ! The spice! I smell it. I smell it on my own breath. I never had any! You must believe me. [remo](remo.md) and I waited until the illithids were the first minute of their precognition And [remo](remo.md) began to Dance. [remo](remo.md) killed fifteen while they had their vision —their vision of their own deaths! [remo](remo.md) killed fifteen mind flayers. He killed them, that's my boy! He Danced with them one last time. He Danced, Oh, [troy](troy.md) it was beautiful to behold! No one ever killed so many, not even Yama.  |  After Barney died and a chance existed that their deity, Cth~~~, was annihilated by [skagganutt](skagganutt.md) at Enseljos, the illithids were no longer bound to inaction. The 49 (47?) moved immediately to the desert of Lomarn and consumed the Fremen spice to combine their perfect probability manipulation with prescience. Hal arrived with [remo](remo.md) , who [dance](dance.md) the Senethar, perhaps ushering in the [dance](dance.md) with this event. [remo](remo.md) slew 15 mind flayers and Hal Destroyed by Fire the remainder, assumed to be 31 (15+31 = 49-3) for [yama](yama.md) and [kalkin](kalkin.md) and Syrinara are known to exist afterwards.  | 
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I used a skull. I destroyed the rest. I did. I used the fire, I ... Fire my fire. Fire, fire, fire, it was the burning. It burned them and they burned They burned and then the water washed their ashes. Cello washed their ashes. Fire and Water It was the ashes They all should have been burned. They fell, burning into the sea. Fire and Water. Those in the sea, burning. Those drowning, burned. They are all gone, even Barney. I killed the rest. My Fire Destroyed them. My Fire Destroyed all but fifteen of the mind flayers. I curse[?] them, but I am too shallow.  |  Hal’s grasp on his personality slips during this memory. Cello, wielder of the weapon Death By Water, aided him in Removing the remains of the illithids Hal Destroyed. Hal was apparently trying to maximize the permanence of the slaying by using two pure elements (Removal by Water and Destruction by Fire) in their undoing. Phrasing suggests that Barney’s skull was among those Destroyed and Removed.  |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I, I have fifteen skulls. I had fifteen. I have hid the other fourteen. I hid them, so no one can find them. I hid them so no one can be... I hid them. Keep them away from the family. I put one in my own head. I want to discover so badly I acted rashly I put one in my head. I acted unwisely I didn't know the power. [troy](troy.md) , Oh Isis, I was [troy](troy.md) . I didn't know you were dead. I put one of the skulls in my head. I can see forever. I can see the moment where I kill myself. I can see the moment where we are dead. I can see my own end. The spice is more than I can take. The skull is more than I can take, The perfection is more. It was worth it. It was worth every second. We did so much. We went so far. Not far enough. We are no longer near the Courts of Chaos. We must be careful. we are too far. I think we are in Rat's Alley, where the dead men lost their bones.  |  Hal has unspecific concern to prevent other Kin of [troy](troy.md) from invoking an illithid skull, and caution regarding the increasing distance between [asteroid](asteroid.md) the Courts of Chaos, the source of much of Trojan power. Rat’s Alley is another reference to [wasteland](wasteland.md) .  |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Tell my wife I love her.  |  Hal’s wife, [remo](remo.md) ’s mother is a silver Dragon whose name is not generally known. [threnody](threnody.md) claims not to remember; I’ll ask her again when next she reincarnates as Llewellyn ap-Owen.  |

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I would welcome assistance with additional or enhanced interpretations of any portion of this message. I should very much like to publish a well-annotated version of this message with meanings behind all the obscure references. With the Destruction of [ko](ko.md) , we are left without valuable insight into Hal’s life. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) I am of the belief that a fourth copy was delivered to Hal’s lifelong friend [ko](ko.md) . [threnody](threnody.md) insists she would have a Dream of the message if this was true, but I remain steadfast that a fourth rod exists in the hands of [ko](ko.md) ’s Destroyer, be it Maeglin or Sethra the Younger. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) It seems abundantly clear to me that Hal was desperately attempting to transfer quantities of knowledge which would otherwise have perished with him. To the best of my knowledge, no people have pursued the contents of this missive before me, despite its grave import. Although only a decade has passed by Wasteland time, much of what Hal feared to see has obviously come to pass. [asteroid](asteroid.md) seems besieged, no longer inspired to the heroism common in the [dreams](dreams.md) . ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) It seems clear to me Hal feared life as an Illithid more than he feared leaving [asteroid](asteroid.md) without his wisdom. Even in death, Hallenrakenthaller demonstrates why [dworkin](dworkin.md) assigned him as Games Authority of the [troad](troad.md) . He may have been evil, but he’s alone done more good for [asteroid](asteroid.md) than all the hypocrites in the Circle of Light together. The pathetic remnant [dhruva](dhruva.md) not withstanding, we shall not see Hal’s like again, and are a lesser people thereby.
