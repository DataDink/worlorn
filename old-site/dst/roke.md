# Roke

 the isle of man

#####  History 
>
>   Mastery of Roke Magic is the First Archmage’s  [greatworks](greatworks.md) . First Archmage set up a school to teach creatures how to master  [wildmagic](wildmagic.md)  so that others might keep  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  in balance, regardless. 

#####  Curriculum 
>
>   Students achieve three ranks of significance in Roke Training. 

1. **Sorcerers** - students who demonstrate a certain minimal understanding and control of personality when dealing with all nine schools of Roke Mastery can achieve formation of a *Roke Clasp of Sorcery*, allowing them a focus for their magics that grants a chance to avoid any supernatural force, *No Matter What*. It is said this level of training takes three years as a Sentient or Dreaming Dragon measures time.

1. **Wizards** - Roke Sorcerers who demonstrate a fine control of all nine schools of Mastery and will submerge their personality to benefit the situation can achieve the formation of a *Roke Staff of Wizardry*, allowing them a focus for their magics which is valid in any Domain and useful to knock open or hold shut any Portal, *No Matter What*.

1. **Mages** - Roke Wizards who demonstrate understanding of Worlorn’s balance sufficiently to change the course of Inspiration are recognized by the Nine Masters with a *Roke Cloak of Magery* for their  [greatworks](greatworks.md) . The enchantment of Cloak of a Roke Mage is not known outside the ranks of its wearers.

#####  Geography 
>
>   Roke Island has these landmarks: 

> 
> 			Patterner’s Immanent Grove / the Door / the court of the Fountain: the sunlit court
> 			 / Great House: Room of Shelves; Hearth Hall / South Tower: sleeping chambers
> 			 / refectory of the Long Table / Back Door / Isolate Tower, on the northern cliffs, above the northern cape
> 			 / Roke Knoll, whose roots go down to the center of the earth
> 			 / Thwil Town / Thwilburn [river] / oak groves where shadows lay thick for all the brightness of the sun
> 			 / Thwil Bay / healing-chamber / Chanter’s Tower: iron bells
> 			
>
>   Roke Island is sustained by the colective will of its students. The Roke colective also sustains Undesignated Wastelands called  [earthsea](earthsea.md) , These Undesignated Wastelands exist regardless of  [void](void.md)  or chaos without Domination by  [wildmagic](wildmagic.md)  or  [goldcard](goldcard.md) gold cards. 

#####  Politics 
>
>   The school is led by one (1) Archmage and nine (9) Masters. 

1. **Changer** -methods and impact of change 
1. **Chanter** -history and discipline 
1. **Doorkeeper** -trust 
1. **Hand** -discernment and enterprise 
1. **Herbal** -nature (life) 
1. **Namer** -comprehension and order 
1. **Patterner** -interrelationships and the present 
1. **Summoner** -authority and control 
1. **Windkey** -travel and direction 

 No Master has been selected who has not reached the status of Roke Mage, and few Archmages have been chosen save from the ranks of the Masters. When the Archmage dies, the Roke Masters choose a successor in closed chambers. 
>
>   In the Cycle of Dance the Archmage decreed that only Humans would be taught to the rank of Wizard or higher. It is believed that the Fire Rat Roke Mage  [digriz](digriz.md)  was relevant to this decision
