you can never go home again

#### Patternfall: macro view
>
>   Once upon a time, the universe was blown up except for 36 turfs, which stand as islands in Chaos. 
>
>   Everything in the universe which could not withstand attack by the Powers of Chaos. It was as if one incident unglued the forces which hold the universe together. Legendary first-hand  [patternfall2](patternfall2.md)  indicate that  [almitra](almitra.md)  called upon her Aspect of Chaos and wielded the Light of the World to Flux the Pattern of Troy.
>
>   Up to the moment it was attacked, the forces of Order from the  [pattern](pattern.md)  held the universe together. Without the Pattern, anything that could not sustain its own Order dissolved into Almitra's Chaos: people, objects, planets. 
>
>   There wasn't much left. In all the worlds, roughly three dozen Artifacts remained intact. Call these 36 artifacts "Golden Attributes" or "Gold Cards." Everything outside the power of a Golden Attribute was reduced to Chaos (formless energy) or Flux (formless matter).
>
>   In the old  [dreams](dreams.md)  universe, the space between the worlds was empty and Void. In the new  [dance](dance.md)  universe, there's a Sea of Chaos between all turfs.
>
>   Some Dreaming turfholders banded together cooperatively under  [oimota](oimota.md)  to recreate  [dominions](dominions.md) . You can  [FIXME: compact](assets/compact.pdf)  to your Oracle.
>
>   Other turfholders did not agree to the peace treaty and  [domains](domains.md)  remain "outside" the Order imposed by The Compact, as Dancing domains.
>
>   This is the foundation of New Worlorn as seen by Dreamers.

#### Patternfall: micro view, from within [troad](troad.md) 
>
>   A Roke Mage's studies from within Troad revealed that all the non-Troad planes of existence were fluxed. If one has not plans to leave Troad then this apocalypse is an ivory-tower academic matter. 
>
>   With one major exception, there are no signs inside of Troad that anything has changed. No Dust Law Dreamers in Troad are over eighth level of experience, and no *er-per’henne* recall a time when it was possible to attain such rank. Apparently Tanngrisnir's 28-Veil Pattern continued to impose only 2/7ths of Troad's Order when Almitra Fluxed the original 20-Veil Pattern.
>
>   Troad’s existence may have been threatened, but its residents for the most part are blissfully ignorant of any changes. When the Abyss or Etherial Plane blow up, no one hears about it on the Prime Material Plane except for powerful wizards and clerics.
