### **ADVENTURES OUT OF DROWLAND:

TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE**



 By Lord Cyris DeAngelo, Great Sage and Keeper of the Tombs of Mestea





  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  [niteblade](niteblade.md)  floated on the  [astral](astral.md) , comptemplating the battle between Dust and Blood.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "A curious thing this  [game](game.md) , " he mused. "One counters the other only to be countered again."

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Niteblade reached out his wings, stretching them to the ends of the stars. He thought of all that he had accomplished since coming here to  [asteroid](asteroid.md)  as Shal-Omnis's emmissary. With  [dominions](dominions.md)  under  [oimota](oimota.md)  established, with  [realoran](realoran.md)  on the outside, with the 12 priest and countless followers, all the remained was to bring HER here.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Yes ... the time is now!" Niteblade's excitement could hardly been contained. He had waited along time for this moment. His prayer shook the heavens.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Oh Great Deity of Dragons, I pray tonight to you amongst the stars. You sent me hear to establish a home ... a place for your light to shine. Through your divine hand, you have carved a place in this world for that light.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Alas, that evil Black Dragon of darkness, has joined forces with the agents of Blood to destroy all that we have accomplished.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "I ask your blessing for the High One, who seeks to preserve the safe-haven we have made.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "I ask for your light to shine amongst the Dragons of all worlds, I ask for your blessing of my brother Realoran, who has served you better than I could have.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "I ask for your guidance in what I must now do.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Oh mighty Shal-Omnis, I open the door through holy word and deed. Your clerics stand with me this night, as do all of your followers. I invite you and your court in ... as your loyal servant, Arch-Angel, and dragon. I stand ready to fight with you and my dragonkin to battle the forces of darkness. I summon the MoonKnights and the Rose and all dragons to lift your heads up for the time is now ... "

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) *Thunder rolled through the heavens. Nebeula gases churned ... stars grew brighter. With a though, Niteblade extended his claw forward. A gate materialized before him, swirling with a mysterious hue of brightly colored lights.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Suddenly, a scream broke through the awe. It was the scream of a gold dragon. Sentient Realoran's scream! 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Nooooooooo!" 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The scream reverberated in the minds of all who had ever dreamed in Worlorn, and all who now dance here. Realoran's voice abruptly became silent. *

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Niteblade's attention is distracted from Realoran as his miracle of faith bears holy fruit. The Gate becomes a light of unbearable nature, it is She! It is The Goddess! A being peerless . . . but wait! She frowns and withdraws! Why? She glances behind herself. She is calling something Niteblade cannot hear, and is gone.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Gate narrows as Niteblade's confusion grows. Fear began to rise within Niteblade. He had defined the gate, invited Shal-Omnis and her court through, what had happened? This gate, was it even his....Suddenly, a black flash obscures Niteblade's vision of the Gate as 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) *a dark humanoid form leaped upon Niteblade. The black thing tore at Niteblade's flesh with claws like spearheads, ignoring metal and leather as if Niteblade's armor were not there! As strong as Niteblade was, this thing seemed just as strong.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The creature crushed Niteblade under the weight of its corrupt form, tearing at Niteblade's skin, putting the gobbets of bloody flesh in its foul smelling mouth.* 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Shal-Omnis, why have you forsaken me!"

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Niteblade, using the powers of Ki dealt a mighty blow to the creature, cracking the skin and skull of the dark humanoid. The creature is barely startled! The dark figure then reaches out and breaks Niteblade's right arm, gnawing on the exposed bones! In agony, Niteblade grabs the creatures left arm, snapping it like a twig.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) *The two forms fought forever; they fought for a minute.* Niteblade does exactly the same damage as the thing does to him. *The battle was perfectly matched, a confrontation of equal opposite forces. There was no quick win; a grueling battle until one of them would no longer be able to make a fist or poke a finger.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) But then, almost by accident, Niteblade cried for SANCTUARY as his Aspect drove the thing backward into the Astral Plane, fleeing with a lop-sided gate into the distance.*

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Why..." Niteblade's feeble, shuddering lips formed the barely audible words. Niteblade was alive ... barely. He lay on the sand too weak to stand or wield the power of  [mestea](mestea.md) .

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Theseus, the Trojan warrior who had fought with Hercules to Gain the Golden Fleece, had just began a walk on the beach when the form of Niteblade fell from the heavens. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Beside Niteblade lay the Gold Dragon's Egg of Mestea ... the source of all power within Mestea. *Reaching down, Theseus picked up the egg and called upon the power of Mestea. In a matter of a moment's desire, Niteblade was healed. Theseus returned the Dragons egg to Niteblade. Niteblade was back to his former self! . . . Or was he? All the tangible parts of his mind and body were complete, but something was missing ... missing, inside, where the heart dwells. There were no answers here as Mestea ... only questions.*

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) *Exhausted, Niteblade collapsed on the sand.*

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Somewhere beyond the Pomerium, Greyson and master of  [voidcastle](voidcastle.md)  smiled. Unknown the Niteblade, Greyson had been a step ahead of Niteblade, the entire time. Styphon, the evil archenemy of Shal-Omnis was already here ... coming on April Fools day the month before. Blood had anticipated Niteblade's actions and were ready. He never stood a chance.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The dark figure of Niteblade lay motionless on the shores of the Isle of Mu, at the heart of Mestea. For an instant, the figure shimmered, looking like humanoid-Drow, and then, for another instant, like a dragon shining with the light of a diamond. This manifestation lasted for one hour ... alternating between the two forms until finally settling on Drow.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Niteblade slowly stirred. There was something strange about his hollow stare ... as if he was looking beyond the present into nothing. Eerily he gazed into the void... his eyes ... no longer the multi-colored eyes of Niteblade but rather, dark, black and sinister.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Slowly Niteblade rose to his feet, as if awakening from a long sleep. Stripping off his shredded armor and clothing, he began to walk, as if in a trance. He walked for what seemed like days until finally arriving at a shimmering pool.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Niteblade peered into the pool for an eternal moment, gazing at his own reflection, as if not knowing who or what he was. Then slowly, he turned around and walked over to a thorny bush. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Bending down, he began to dig beneath the brush, pulling forth a dusty parcel about the size of a small crate. Brushing the dirt from the parcel, the dark figure slowly begans to unwrap the parcel. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Within the parcel were dark clothes and dark boots and dark weapons. The dark figure donned the clothing as if he had done it a thousand times before, silently and methodically putting each component into place. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Ominously, Niteblade slowly walked over to the glimmering pool. Violently, he thrust his arm into the elements, drawing forth an obsidian dagger. Rising, he turned into the light. His new attire, bearing the ancient symbol of the Horadim, the most fear of assassins. His mark bore the symbol of The Grandfather Assassin, the leader. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The obsidean dagger suddenly sprang to life, singing its name in the minds of the dancers and dreamers.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  "BloodSong ... Devourer of Blood Souls". 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) This was not the Niteblade all had known. This form had no soul, no heart, no morals. Utterly evil and insane, Niteblade smiled the treacherous smile. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Wait till they get a load of me ... " he laughed. For a moment, time stood still, and then Niteblade was gone.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The party at Voidcastle grew suddenly quiet. No one was  [dance](dance.md)  ... no one was singing. Greyson stood on the balcony of the Tower of Lorainne, gazing off into  [greyspace](greyspace.md) .

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "This wasn't exactly how you said things would turn out, is it?" Greyson said, speaking to a dark figure hidden within the shadows.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "No ... " the figure replied. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Back on the Island of Mu, Theseus was troubled. Walking to where Niteblade had just moments before stood, he reached down into the sand and pulls forth the Golden Dragon's egg of Mestea. Gazing up into the stars he stood for three days, tears forming a pool beneath him.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) That pool still remains. It is called the Dark Pool of Tears, after the former Niteblade. What happened to Niteblade is shrouded in secrecy. Attempts to find him have failed.
