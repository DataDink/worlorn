  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The 'ancient' Trojan assassin guild of Horadim instantly become a Worlorn-wide phenomenon. Thousands of zero-experience point dancing NPCs spread throughout Worlorn's turfs . . . overnight. Randomly generated assassins are equally likely to be members of the Horadim guild as any other guild. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The three guilds of the Worlorn Wastelands "Astral Plane" and "Carsultyl" are Darlolilm Jedide under Grandfather Summer, Stormtroopers under Grandfather Darth, and the Horadim, shrouded in secrecy. Only Darlolilm Jedide survive in the Worlorn Wasteland called Voidcastle. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The first two guilds are instantly and formally allied against any member of the Horadim guild as they would against a freelance assassin. This alliance places the Horadim at a political dis-advantage, but the almost magical speed at which the Horadim appear makes it possible for the Horadim to establish themselves thoroughly and permanently in a world dominated by the Darolilm Jedide and Stormtrooper guilds.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Many turfs are open to assassin guild NPC activity without need for anyone to define that activity: Fountainhead, New Troad, Flambeau, Hissarlik, Open Road, Watersea, Alexander Troas, Shadow Lands, Dragon Isles, Elidor, perhaps even Kaldamaaren, Crosswinds and Llewghund. These turfs have no established tendency to evict people simply for being evil or assassin-like in nature. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Specific PC activity or explicit PC plans are required to insinuate Horadim in "every" turf. Insinuating organized NPC assassin guilds into explicitly non-adventuring turfs requires d-state adventures to establish each and every guild for these turfs: such as Dry Land, Skagganutt Abyss, Musquel, the Forest Within, Heaven, and Hell. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Assassin characters, let alone assassin guilds, must be handled on a person-by-person basis upon entering 'peaceful' turfs like Mestea, Los Endos, Isle of Sleep, and Dolbadarn. One might guess that these turfs will become aware of Horadim well before any are established in their boundaries.
