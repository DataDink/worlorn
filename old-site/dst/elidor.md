>   elidor, an island on the watersea, is the memoir of a previous cycle. elidor is to history as troad is to dreams. elidor is to history as gateway is to astronomy. at elidor, where there are four, there once were eight. everything else is history.
>
>   four castles remain on elidor: one at each of the cardinal points. two major roads remain on elidor: east-west and north-south. if there's a light at a castle, it's safe for comedians, astronomers, historians, and dreamers to enter.
>
>   gorias is the eastern castle of elidor. findias is the southern castle on elidor. falias is the western castle on elidor. murias is the northern castle on elidor. order is important.
>
>   vandwy is a burial mound on elidor, at the crossroads. vandwy is always safe for comedians and astronomers; never safe for historians; and rarely safe for dreamers.
>
>   the evoker tree is another important landmark. you can see the evoker tree if you look west of the crossroads. do not stand beneath the evoker tree at sunrise or sunset unless you're immune to fire. falias is not immune to fire.
