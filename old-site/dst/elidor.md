  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  elidor, an island on the watersea, is the memoir of a previous cycle. elidor is to history as troad is to dreams. elidor is to history as gateway is to astronomy. at elidor, where there are four, there once were eight. everything else is history.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  four castles remain on elidor: one at each of the cardinal points. two major roads remain on elidor: east-west and north-south. if there's a light at a castle, it's safe for comedians, astronomers, historians, and dreamers to enter.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  gorias is the eastern castle of elidor. findias is the southern castle on elidor. falias is the western castle on elidor. murias is the northern castle on elidor. order is important.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  vandwy is a burial mound on elidor, at the crossroads. vandwy is always safe for comedians and astronomers; never safe for historians; and rarely safe for dreamers.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the evoker tree is another important landmark. you can see the evoker tree if you look west of the crossroads. do not stand beneath the evoker tree at sunrise or sunset unless you're immune to fire. falias is not immune to fire.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  the history of worlorn is important to tiresias. history became possible with the  [akashik](akashik.md) , a journal of a spirit's timeline recorded and reproducable, repeatable. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  one should learn from one's mistakes. those who fail to recall the past are doomed to repeat it.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **the atrium of time** is wielded by tiresias. the atrium of time is the remaining half of kolwynia, the key that was lost. kolwynia remains the sum of four parts.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **the spear ildana** was wielded by esras. the spear sheds the light of truth.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **the talking sword of lothia** was wielded by uscras. the sword of lothia speaks truth and falsehood in unequal measure.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **the eye of timor** was wielded by morfesa. the eye of timor restores akashik records of a wathan to true flesh.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  **the jade bowl** was wielded by semias. the jade bowl views the truth.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  there is more history about  [kolwynia](kolwynia.md) . 
 ** [highone](highone.md) ** on the atrium of time:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **kolwynia** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *history* in worlorn, including but not limited to akashic records, divinations of the past, legend lore, time travel, temporal stasis, time stop, haste, slow, and supernatural retroactive effects.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) bretons are humans of various stock: black, brown, yellow, white, blue, and even green. there is no special characteristic for bretons. they tend not to be comedians, dreamers, or astronomers.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) bretons prefer to live in houses of stone or brick. they are hearty fighters but prefer peace. the magic of bretons is difficult to understand for comedians, astronomers, and dreamers.
