  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Kaldamaaren is a great hall set deep within the earth. A huge forge is centered near the Blue Eye Anvil numerous other forges and anvils are set within the cavernous hall. All around the hall, enormous sets of chains and block and tackle hang from the a ceiling. One set of chains, perhaps the most massive of all, reaches up into the darkest recesses of the ceiling, far out of the light of the fires. It drops down to turn a massive waterwheel that dips into an otherwise still underground river and lifts the cold water up into an intricate system of troughs to feed the cooling barrels and pools scattered about the chamber. The heat here is beyond opressive, perhaps more than stifling. Since most of the occupants of the Hall are made of living stone, it isn't much of a consideration. Also scattered around the hall are racks upon racks of tools (gotta have the right tool for the right job!). And stacks of many types of (sometimes precious) raw materials. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) High up on one wall of the Hall is a broad balcony. Often when not hard at work on some wonder or other, Damon surveys the Hall from this balcony. Behind it is a second hall. Not cavernous like the Great Forge, but rather with a flat (if rather lofty) ceiling of polished stone. It is brightly lit, where the Great Forge is red and flickers with only the light of the forges to see by. The great height of this Hall is not appearant at first because of its unnatural length. It stretches out for uncounted distance and all along its length are doors of every shape and size. Damon is probably the only one who knows where they all lead (then again, he might not have a clue either, but nobody mentions it to his face).

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Beyond the two great halls are labyrinthine passages leading to personal chambers, to mines for raw materials, storerooms (and reputedly treasure room or what Damon calls 'the rooms where I put the stuff I made and didn't get around to givin' to somebody') and myriad other places. Non-natives probably need a guide or they risk starving to death in a little used hallway.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **Damon** is a male Huldrafolk of indeterminate age. He's known to be illiterate, although that hasn't stopped him from  [goldbowl](goldbowl.md) . He's been blooded in battle (and reportedly used a hammer he calls Basher), but prefers the excitement he finds in the forge. He also reputedly spent some time as an elf, but that seems hardly credible.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Damon Maker is reportedly a Nightmare of the Great Smith Champion Eternal. Damon was lead to recognize his potential only after Champion Dwarfgod had passed into retirement with the Mistress fo Abandoned Dreams.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Damon makes stuff. Damon has rules about making stuff. Damon's instructions to the Huldrafolk about making stuff might, if he's gracious, be made public. Someday. Ask any dwarf if you gots questions.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Blue Eye Anvil is an enormous anvil. Only upon it can the most powerful items be made. wielding it is a long and taxing endeavor, as it can even test Damon's stony constitution. Materials of the finest quality are required to produce an item to act as vessel to great powers. Persistant rumors of a bad experience Damon had repeatedly trying to make rapiers seem to give motive to his preference to making unique items rather than that being a requirement of the Anvil.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The 'Blue Eye' of the Anvil can scry any item made upon it. A ringing hammerblow upon it from Basher can 'Make you listen' (he cannot choose but hear...). Any wielder of the Anvil comes to have unnaturally deep blue eyes. Damon's are reputedly now actually living saphires. People with blue eyes have a better chance to succeed in making something when they try. Anvils made on the Anvil of making also increase the chance to succeed in making something. 

 
 **the high one** on The Blue Eye Anvil:

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) the **Anvil of Making** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *making* in worlorn, including but not limited to making things, making love, making war, making something of it, and making sense. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) The Anvil has not been known to make something from nothing.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Made by Damon himself, these beings of living stone (a gift granted by the Phoenix) are not bound by death as boon to Damon from the Deathgod for a favor Damon doesn't quite understand (big surprise there!). They are a dreaming race endowed with Damon's love of good, solid, lasting craftsmanship. They are solid warriors, but not overmuch interested in mercenary service to non-Huldarfolk. When using a hammer or axe or armor they made themselves, they receive extra blessing from Damon.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Huldrafolk, as rule, do not speak falsely, they take oaths seriously and having sworn one, do their utmost to uphold it. They look to the good of the 'folk as their first concern, even above their own well-being, and this is considered even before any oath would be spoken. Personal Honor is a function of following that maxim first, and then maintaining one's own integrity, all other things flowing from that.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) They are not xenophobic, but they are not easily trusting of outsiders, either. They seldom form more than shallow relationships with non-Huldrafolk, however, when they give their trust and friendship it is without reserve. Needless to say, when that trust is betrayed, Huldrafolk seek retribution upon the betrayer as if an oath had been broken.
