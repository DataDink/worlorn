# dhruva

the star, steadfast

```
A palpable absence of desire
Surrounds hopes and dreams lost.
Drifting, never touching.
Hovering, indecisive, seemingly forever.
A sigh of resignation
Settles within a Star.
A gasp of rebirth fades to
Silence with realization.
The fragility of hope
Is a fact of existence.
Swayed. Neutral. Balanced.
Meaningless without direction.
Everyone is a neighbor of Pain.
Broken back, weeping face.
The world shivers, caught between
What might and must and won't be.

```
