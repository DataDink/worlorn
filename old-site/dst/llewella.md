 An emessary from New Troad asked me to point out that you've omitted The Greater Prince of Evil Drow Devils, Threnody. Is this a proposal to meet in Watersea's Foyer, a place where all but Threnody can remain at home while still meeting? I don't know of a place within a tesseract where all eight sovereigns can meet while remaining within our domains, only places where seven turfs are congruent. 

 What was that, emessary? Oh, I'm so sorry; I didn't realize it was a private matter that the aforementioned suggestion came from New Troad. I'm truly sorry. I do grow so confused during private negotiations. Why don't we make an attempt speak plainly for our Turfs for all of us to hear if any wish to deal with Watersea. I'm less likely to be befuddled into unintentionally betraying confidences if there are none. 

 The Prince Who Was 1000 is not in command of Watersea. I am. There was no coup. I hold the Watersea Focus he willingly gave into my possession. I did not steal or deprive Aleksander of this Watersea Focus, Aleks gave it to the Prince, Llyr. in turn Llyr gave it to me before he began sleeping on the Watersea throne. I choose not to attempt awakening The Prince, Llyr, allowing him to sleep until he is fully rested. My sisters Dierdre and Florimel fully agree with me in this decision.

 Thank you for your message to the Sovereign of Watersea. Your greetings will be forwarded to The Prince. Unfortunately he is unavailable just now and cannot be disturbed. I hope I may be of service to you. I am Princess Llewella, the bearer of the Watersea Focus. I shall address the matters recently proposed by an emissary from Crosswinds.

 Sovereigns are likely to push personal scheming as far as they think they can get away with. While the Prince Who Was 1000 is well- pleased by scheming, he has permitted me to be in charge of the edit process on the behalf of Watersea. I am no schemer. 

 I plan to Take up the Attribute of the Watersea to Remove any edits which Watersea has not had the opportunity to Veto. If any of us use our Aspect and Attributes to scheme instead of preserve fair play, we will have a circus going instead of a Compact of fair promises made in good faith. 

 I guess that the  [deathgod](deathgod.md)  and  [prince1000](prince1000.md)  might be pleased by such intrigue enough to condone it, and even participate. However, I prefer to be a part of a cooperative agreement rather than a contract signed under duress. I suppose I am my daughter's mother. 

 Llewella, Princess Llyr of Watersea
