>   Necrodemus established a pantheon of eight churches of legal worship within his newfound empire. The eight churches thrived under the new empire while other religions stagnated.

>   With the Necrodemian Deathgod in control of  [akashik](akashik.md)  and the Necrodemian Phoenix in control of  [mortalcoil](mortalcoil.md) , unfaithful souls and spirits began to leave the world permenently upon death, with no hope for reincarnation or ressurrection of the wathan. 
>
>   Religious persecution was severe for non-Pantheon religions. Necrodemian Law did not tolerate other religions. Public worship of non-Pantheon deities was punishable by execution anywhere except the Street of the Gods in Imperial Enseljos, a lengthy boulevard lined with temples of all cultures. 
>
>   Red Light began to affect clerics caught outside of their temples, severely restricting the spread of non-Necrodemian religions. 
>
>   Forest Coven—druids—were not tolerated, and worship of nature was punishable as any other heretic religion. Necrodemian officials paid gold for the wooden torcs that deepwood druids wore, living wood necklaces grown in place about the neck. There was only one way to remove them intact. The bloody profession of “dragging for torcs” became common, if unrespected.
