# lillith



 fangs for the memories

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Anyone who’s anyone knows that Lillith is the daughter of Aeol the Dark Smith and Helen The Dark. That’s the story and everyone is sticking to it. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Helen of Aeol, the Gold Dust Woman, bore twins some time in the year after Aeol completed the Morganti weapons: a son Alexander Copis and a daughter Lillith. Lillith’s brother Alex was an iahklu personally killed by  [yama](yama.md) , and was seen only once thereafter, on  [paths](paths.md) . 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith was born a vampire and therefore believes she is the daughter of Vlad Drakulya. Supporting evidence exists: neither Aeol nor Helen was a vampire, and Vlad Drakulya was rumored to have dallied with Dark Helen for a time during the enchantments. Alexander Copis was not a vampire. It is known that a pregnant woman who has relations with a vampire will bear twins: one a vampire, one immune to vampirism. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Rumors suggest Dark Helen bore triplets, the third child, born dead, drained by fangs in the womb. Stories say Helen cursed and screamed when she was told she could bear no more children because of ... damage done during a terrible first pregnancy. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith learned the ways of men at Bird Keep, sneaking out on weekends to train as a thief with  [hermione](hermione.md) . Although Lillith uses her Bird training without reserve, her only known relationship was with Nathan Stack, founder and High Priest in the Church of the Snake. Lillith and Stack cross trained in their fighting ways: Lillith is a trimarchi in the schools of the Bat, Snake, and Spider, while Stack is a dimarchi Bat and Snake. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  While not known as religious, in the Cycle of  [dance](dance.md)  Lillith has forced her matriarchy at knifepoint to turn from the spider queen Llolth to a different evil deity named Sekkar. Lillith has never displayed any residual Dust power from hanging around  [dira](dira.md) , the  [hosts](hosts.md)  of  [game](game.md)  in the Cycle of  [dreams](dreams.md) . These proper names are not to be spoken out loud by god-fearing persons. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith loves war. It is rumored that in exchange for training in strategy and tactics she defeated, enslaved, and sold her beautiful replicant mother to a Stealth Master Elite named Greyson. She is always leading the Hellene Drow in uprisings against the Dark Children who escaped the matriarchy of the Vault of the Drow to live in Carsultyl Holdfast. Vlad Petros was heard to accuse Lillith of assisting the Illithids attacking his place of power during the Cycle of Dance. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith has spent much of her life harassing House Drakulya, trying to be recognized in any manner, but Vlad Tepes did not acknowledge her, and none of his offspring have recognized Lillith either. Lillith bears the white adamantine i, mai, and oude of the School of the Bat, although no living Bat School weapons instructor admits to teaching Lillith. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith always hated Aeol, before during and after he lead the uprising against Helen. Lillith continues to hate Maeglin, her younger half-brother sired by Aeol during an affair with Aladrahel that lead Lillith’s mother morganti-ing Lillith’s father. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lillith is arguably 2nd generation Kin of Troy, peer to  [eressea](eressea.md) ,  [hal](hal.md)  and others. Replicant Blood has proven sufficient magically, but politically Lillith is disdained by the Kin in the same breath dismissing Dark Helen as genetic garbage, a magical accident. Lillith and Stack have no known children.
