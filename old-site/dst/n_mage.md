 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Necrodemus I summoned a supernatural barrier to prevent mages from calling on the powers of other planes. This barrier was called the *Pomerium* shield, and it nullified virtually all existing wizard spells. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Necrodemus allowed mages to cast spells from the Imperial Orb for only the costs of Necrodemian Citizenship: a thousand gold ounces per year with an annual pledge of fealty. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Some mages refused to pay, some refused to pledge, and two of these found alternate means of piercing Nercodemus' Pomerium: the coven god Tranodeli and the weirmoniken mage Brandon Talaar. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Larethian and Kav elfar clans managed to independently develop their own brands of racial focii. Necrodemian Law eventually embraced the Holdfast focus and Holdfast blade for legal use within the empire. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Some of the more dogged mages managed to develop a personal focus, but this is a carefully guarded and individualistic spellcraft handed down by teacher to student in privacy, hidden from Necrodemian law.
