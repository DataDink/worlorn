>   The adventure begins in Saltpeter's Estate, with Iakhlu Crimson Gray, Kiera, and Ryndall. Ryndall is joined by his Er'perhenne Molon Nightingale. Crimson's expected Er'perhenne Vlad Petros is not present, having been called away on some personal business (recruiting a replacement for a recent vacancy in his organization). When Crimson comments on some wounds sustained in the previous Crossing In The Mist, *Er'perhenne*  [maja](maja.md)  appears and heals him.
>
>   The party discusses how best to deal with the next Veil, and debates whether to first detour to rescue the Er'perhenne Faella from what they believe is "demon possession". The general consensus (with some reluctance by Crimson) is that the Veil must come first, or all that Faella was striving for would be in vain. Kiera proposes a plan that might complete the entire Patternwalk in only one or two Crossings, and Ryndall suggests an enhancement that might save Faella too. Just as they are preparing to leave the Estate, the Iakhlu Derek awakens and joins. The party (Iakhlu and Molon) takes to the winds to travel to the docks of Port Suame.
>
>   When they arrive, they see The Midnight Myst still/again docked in a berth. Along with the Er'perhenne captain and crew is the Iakhlu Minni, who is an avatar generated from Llewghund. Minni calls Crimson "Stretch", and bears Faella's sword. Crimson, Ryndall, and Molon are prevented by the ship captain from boarding, as they are accused by the captain of abandoning Faella in her hour of need. Crimson tells his side of the story, and says that he is working on saving Faella, if the party is given passage to Castle Murias on Elidor. The Er'perhenne captain looks at the Iakhlu Minni, and seeing that she seems favorably disposed towards Crimson's plea, assents. Crimson, Ryndall, and Molon are allowed on board, and the ship sails to Elidor. 
>
>   The ship arrives at the base of a cliff in fog, and the party disembarks. The captain says that they will not be given passage back without proof of Faella's rescue. The party ascends the cliff in the wind, and notes the signpost "Murias" next to the entrance to the castle. (Ryndall notes a familiar-looking tree growing on the other side of the path.) All the Iakhlu touch the walls of the castle, followed by the Er'perhenne Molon.

>   The adventure begins just outside the Castle Murias on Elidor, with Iakhlu Crimson Gray, Kiera, Derek, Minni, and Ryndall. Ryndall is joined by his Er'perhenne Molon Nightingale. Kiera begins the adventure with the Eye of Timor (which she hands to Minni), the Jade Cauldron (which she hands to Ryndall), the Talking Sword of Lothia (which she hands to Derek), and the Spear Illdana (which she hands to Crimson). She explains that each must take their item to the proper place in one of the four Castles, whereupon she will Dance in the proper place in the center of the Island. With no random nor non-random encounters, and with the distribution of Ryndall's food and water, the setup is successfully performed.
