 Eressea establishes an orphanage at Dolbadarn, under her personal supervision when awake but attended by senior Eressenes at all times. Eressenes who come across orphans or abandoned children can bring them to Dolbadarn where they will be raised and schooled. Also, as it comes up (if ever), the place can also function as "day care" for dreamer moms, too. Young Lydia, whom Eressea healed, is the first child of note to be raised there. The inspiration for the place comes from a song from Les Miserables, "Castle on a Cloud": 


 


```
  There is a castle on a cloud.
  I like to go there in my sleep.
  Aren't any floors for me to sweep,
  Not in my castle on a cloud.
  There is a room that's full of toys.
  There are a hundred boys and girls.
  Nobody shouts or talks too loud,
  Not in my castle on a cloud.
  There is a lady all in white
  Who holds me and sings a lullaby.
  She's nice to see and she's soft to touch.
  She says, "Cosette, I love you very much".
  There is a place where no one's lost.
  There is a place where no one cries.
  Crying at all is not allowed,
  Not in my castle on cloud.

```

 sung by a young orphan girl who cleans up in a saloon in Paris.
