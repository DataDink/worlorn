# astral plane

wasteland between the outer planes

###  [niteblade](niteblade.md) 

invented a wasteland
>
>  *From each of your perceptions, something very much like a worm-hole just opened up on the Astral Plane (in a previously non-align portion of space) and something or someone is coming through ....*

###  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md) 

acknowledged niteblade's creation
>
>  *Chrysofar is watching and waiting to see what comes through that gate. It had BETTER not resemble a dancing dragon. :P Are the rest of you paying attention so we can avert a possible disaster here?*

### Observations
>
>  This above-detailed meeting of the minds between the dominators of  [crosswinds](crosswinds.md)  and  [mestea](mestea.md)  formed an astral plane among the wastelands of  [asteroid](asteroid.md) . WIND CHIMES and SANCTUARY OF MESTEA have now empowered a plane of the Wasteland called the Astral Plane.
>
>  Astral Plane is congruent with all of  [dominions](dominions.md)  and the 'outer planes' of the  [domains](domains.md)  In other words, the astral plane lets you travel from any turf within Oimota's Worlorn to any of the turfs outside of Oimota's Worlorn. This definiton must be applied by the dominator sponsoring a crossing-in-the-mist unless local conditions intrude.
>
>  The list of Wastelands *explicitly* ratified by more than one turfholder thus has been increased to three members:

1. Astral Plane (congruent with all turfs) 
1. Carsultyl (congruent with  [dryland](dryland.md) ,  [flambeau](flambeau.md) ,  [skagganutt](skagganutt.md) ,  [watersea](watersea.md) ,  [dolbadarn](dolbadarn.md) ) 
1. Voidcastle (void of congruency)
>
>  Wastelands *implicitly* ratified by  [dominions](dominions.md)  can be discovered by studying locations named 'wasteland' in  [compact](compact.md) :

* 6.1.2 Undesignated Wasteland: Earthsea 
* 6.17.5 Wizard tower locations.
>
>  ALL  [places](places.md)  in the  [compact](compact.md)  are implicitly ratified and sustained by  [dominions](dominions.md) .
