>  the lake of dreams has but one island, the isle of sleep. it is a world of tiers, an island like a wedding cake with five levels of jungle. one level is dedicated to each element.
>
>  the isle of sleep has five structures. a petitioner for the muse of dreams must visit each of four castles to be granted unhindered entrance into the palladium.
>
>  the palladium is the place where  [troy](troy.md)  brought to rest the statue of the muse of dreams.
>
>  every april 24 since kolwynia was lost, there has been a great battle for the statue of the muse at the palladium. if you're not pretty damn certain you can make a difference, you probably want to be elsewhere. **hermione** would rather not see you here if she'll have to clean you off the floors the next morning.

>  **hermione** is a woman, said to be a pale shadow of klesst silverhand, hermione's cousin. considering dark helen was a pale shadow of hermione's mother, this shadow business may not be as bad as it seems. she is twin to her brother, richelieu's son. **hermione's **other twin brother is barrion of windhaven.
>
>  **hermione** stands approximately 5'6" tall, and weighs 116 pounds, like virtually every elfar you know. duh!
>
>  **hermione** has been a daughter, a mother, a wife, and a dominator. sometimes the boundaries are not so keen. she has been an illithid as well as a goldcard weilder, and boy, that was a trip! brains! send more cops!
>
>  she learned a lot from riding the gold road. **hermione **is a competent fighter/magic user when she's not stealing hearts or gemstones. she's not a competent thief; like, what fun is there in that? however, **hermione** is very, very good. her teachers include margeaux escargot and talbot and barrion, kiron and boz and kem, salt peter and queen mother and necrodemus, and even that sniveling whiner Acreon was able to come up with a few new tricks for her to steal.
>
>  she stole the orb of kings, despite the legends saying only a man can touch it. **hermione** gave the orb away afterwards, to her good friend necrodemus, so he could become emperor. what a silly fellow.
>
>  in addition to the  [attribute](#attribute) , **hermione **weilds those annoying flat-13 save items from knock: master control devices for mind flayers (illithids), gith (a superset of humans), and elementals. she's always on the lookout for more master control devices, but she won't pay for them. just tell her where they are and she'll give you the big bucks.
>
>  she prefers to wear light colored chemises and laces under leather. and oh, yeah, long gloves and boots. loooong gloves. she likes any sort of jewelry, especially dangly things like pendants and earrings, especially on special occasions, especially when she doesn't have to go out to find the pretty ones herself, waldann...

>  **hermione** is blonde! a hyuh-eyh! ;-)

>  there are twenty eight sentient dancers under the isle of sleep. eighteen of these were sentient dreamers. we only lost two.
>
>  sentient tloluvin is dead. there are no known free sentient cheaters. it would be to our advantage to visit the isle of sleep swiftly if you know of a free sentient dancer.
>
>  from the isle of sleep  [weilder](#weilder)  weilds a ** [muses](muses.md)  of dreams: blood law** which continues to reward sentient dreamers with blood law dreams into this new  [dance](dance.md) . hey there, cousin  [remo](remo.md) !

>  the orb was brought from crosstime, where it was merely the orb of the eternal grand dragon. once within worlorn, the orb became empowered to control sentient dragons. legends regarding this improvement are unclear, but everyone who's anyone knows ko came from crosstime. double-duh!

 **the high one** on the orb of sentient dragon control:
>
>  the **orb of sentient dragon control** provides, supports, and controls nine-tenths of all manifestations of *sentience* in worlorn, including but not limited to sentient dancers, sentient dreamers, sentient historians, sentient astronomers, sentient comedians and sentients hitherto uninspired by any muse. the orb of sentient dragon control has the power to enslave any sentient or dragon participating in a crossing-in-the-mist under any muse of worlorn.

>  hellene drow are the foundations of the traditional matriarchy of the dark elves. you know, chaotic evil malibu barbies, who are very good at being slavers, merchants, competent as high priestesses to the spider queen, with all sorts of natural abilities as long as we don't come out in the sunlight.

>  now the hellenes are the richest society of worlorn. unfortunately, they are also the most decadent. sigh. girls, girls, girls....
