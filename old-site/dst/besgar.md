# besgar knightshade



 as he saw, so was he seen

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Besgar Knightshade is studying the strange universe known as  [asteroid](asteroid.md) , and finds he's opened himself up to the Worlorn magical system a bit more than he intended. A portion of the world Worlorn reaches out and finds Besgar! 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  A gate opens up connecting Worlorn with the plane of Besgar’s divinity. The gate appears to be opened at the will and power of a  [nitefall](nitefall.md) , a male Drow. This elf reaches through the gate into Besgar’s home, without invitation, and attempts to hand something to Besgar. The item appears to be a skeleton key made of pale green glass. “Take it!” commmands the Drow. He shakes the key for emphasis. “Take it!” 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Besgar calls upon various powers at his command to secure possession of the key. The gate to Worlorn closes instantly, but not perfectly. There is a link that cannot be severed while the key remains within Besgar’s Cradle of Life. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Studying the key, Besgar determines this is an artifact of great power, with permanent links to the Worlorn System. As long as Besgar controls the key, his plane ajoins the Worlorn System, much like an anchor hold a ship to the sea bottom or a pier.. Within the Worlorn System the key is Named with a True Name, ***The Peridot Key***. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  One presumes that a magic item functions in the manner Besgar prefers within the perfect confines of Besgar’s home plane. Thus, if Besgar wishes to know how the Peridot Key operates in Worlorn, he should study the key within the Worlorn system, rather than how it performs in the plane of his whimsy. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Within the Worlorn System, this is one of few  [wildmagic](wildmagic.md) : one of the irresistable forces, an immovable object... 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Unfortunately, much of the  [FIXME: attribute](attribute.md)  is shrouded in secrecy.
