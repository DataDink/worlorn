# Dust in the Wind

 Ou-est Brutus?

```

>From: "Chrysofar, Last Defender of Troy"
>Et tu, brute?
reality check. you killed off all my iahklu, and then have 
the gall to call me traitor? you left your knife in my back,
not the other way around.
go away. stop bothering me. you have become a monster
i no longer recognize.
Tanngrisnir
