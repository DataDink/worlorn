### Realorin vs. Cyan Bloodbane

 
 * Eressea **will** examine Realorin (metaphysically). What similarities and differences are there between this dragon and the one that Threnody spoke of? * 


 Realoran is the sentience of an enhanced traditional gold dragon and Cyan Bloodbane was an enhanced traditional green dragon. 


 Realoran entered Worlorn bodiless in a prosthesis, where Cyan was brought bodiless to Worlorn bound in/to a racial slaver-control device. Cyan was a wathan captured in an Orb of Sentient Dragon Control. Realoran is a wathan in a fully ambulatory creature-like device subject to Realoran's will. 


 Realoran is much as Dark Helen was, much as the Theocrat was, much as Thufir Hawat is (these three Nexus replicants are analagous to Realoran's Attribute, self-aware device nature, NOT analagous to wathans of sentient power level shared by Cyan and Realoran). Cyan Bloodbane was much as Colbart is: a disembodied wathan caught in a device allowing no recourse and no choices. 


 Cyan Bloodbane & Realoran possess(ed) identical potential to become a Sentient Cheater like Tloluvin was and Mewick is. Cyan's prison and Realoran's magical prosthesis are  [goldcard](goldcard.md) ; either could serve as or focus for  [dominions](dominions.md) .
