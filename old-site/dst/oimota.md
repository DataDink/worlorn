>  Oimota: The Crown of Worlorn is one of the artifacts which are said to pre-date the Trojan empire: the crown Oimota, a rod (various names), and an orb (The Heart of The Earth). This trio of Attributes is perhaps the first of the strange things on Worlorn Troy Ounces was attracted to. The legends never mention the traditional fourth member of such a set: a sword has never been associated with Oimota.

>  In the  [dreams](dreams.md) , it was said a small girl-childe could be found on the  [goldroad](goldroad.md) , dragging Oimota behind on a string. Despite its age and power, Oimota survived Patternfall only as one of Sentient Rib's Nightmare Golden Attractors.
