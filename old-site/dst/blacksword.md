Phoenix, Threnody's Nightmare

Subject: Blacksword rises from the ashes
Know that Blacksword suddenly finds himself in a land 
called "The Fountains of Paradise" where all the people 
are elves who worship him as a god. Blacksword wears 
an Amulet of Great Beauty and great weight, "The Star 
of Beauty" from which all charisma and beauty comes 
for [Worlorn]. In addition to controlling Life 
Ressurrection, and and Rebirth, The Phoenix Blacksword 
suddenly finds himself responsible for beauty throughout 
[Worlorn].
Unfortunately, Blacksword's twin skippy (Threnody) is 
oddly unavailable for conversations, so you need to 
find others for advice. Threnody was put into a magical 
sleep during his last crossing-in-the-mist, and has 
not been awakened.
Two er-per’henne are available for conversation 
in Blacksword's turf "The Fountains of Paradise." 
Gules Lyon (Blacksword's son!?!) is a leader of 
the Phoenix Fighter School, and Perris high-Larteyn, 
is the Pope of the religion worshipping rebirth and 
Life via the Phoenix. 
Perris suggests The Phoneix Blacksword work with 
Eressea, who he says may be trusted to ensure The 
Compact grants the followers of Phoenix fighter 
schools and Phoneix religions magical abilities 
based on the power of the Phoenix's Star of Beauty. 
For example, Perris says The Phoneix Blacksword may 
write a rule in the Compact (ask Eressea for help 
with the wording) which guarantees every two-sword 
Phoenix fighter a ring of human influence (charisma-
based persuasion), and every Cannon of the Phoneix 
(6th level Cleric) a rod of beguiling. These are 
examples supplied by Perris. Gules Lyon suggests that 
Phoenician figthers be granted the power to enthrall 
enemies with beautiful swordplay, so that no enemy 
will foolishly cause unnecessary battle. Gules 
suggsts Phoenician priests be granted the ability to
penetrate elven charm immunity., and be 100% immune 
to other charms instead of 90% immune.
Both Gules Lyon and Perris agree that you should write
a rule which guarantees ressurrection or rebirth
to Phoenician fighters and clerics who are brought
to Phoenician temples. They agree to this as if
it were an obvious truth.
Using the theme of Beauty, Blacksword can certainly come 
up with his own ideas to grant powers of life and beauty
to followers of The Phoenix Blacksword. This beauty 
is what attracted Hannibal Lecter to Ozzy Fudd. Good 
thing Hannibal was mistaken which of Sentient Pat's dreams
was Llewellyn's Nightmare....
With The Phoenix Blacksword's permisison, Perris will show 
The Phoenix Blacksword how to make a magic mirror from the 
Star of Beauty, in order that The Phoenix Blacksword may 
watch over his people, the entire Phoenician elven race. 
Historically, this 'mirror' has been the surface of a 
river which flows the length of the Fountains of Paradise,
Pat may change the form to suit Blacksword's whim, Perris
seems to think it's imperative for a turf holder to make a 
mirror as his first offical act.
