# dust in the wind

 Ambassador Morinâ€™s mission to Crosswinds

**Lord Morin of the Gith wrote:

** *Can I provide people I care about (like myself for instance) with long coats to keep the dust away? I'll call them *dusters*. Or maybe just short thin coats called *windbreakers* that will protect the wearer from the wind?* 
Lord Morin, you are a gem beyond price!

>   Lord Morin, if you would be so kind, please immediately visit the Lady  [chrysofar](chrysofar.md)  at  [crosswinds](crosswinds.md) . Ask her in private what she would demand from the  [FIXME: lakeofdreams](lakeofdreams.md)  to supply our royal self plus 49 Githzerai and 49 Githyanki with  [FIXME: whitecard](whitecard.md)  WIND and DUST immunity devices? They truly fall within her sovereignty and not our own.

>   If Lord Morin wishes to negotiate for more than 99 of each device, please feel free to use your own judgement and any personal wealth you have accumulated. However, the Isle of Sleep is interested in negotiating with Crosswinds only for 99 White Card Windbreakers and 99 White Card Dusters to supply our meager needs, and therefore Isle of Sleep is interested in paying only the cost of this request. If your personal desires are in conflict with ours, at this time we must demand Ambassador Morin withhold his personal wishes regarding this matter.

>   Please inform the Lady of Crosswinds directly that we are interested in negotiating only for White Card Windbreakers that make the wearer immune to WIND and only for White Card Dusters that make the wearer immune to DUST. We are not interested in a simulation of immunity such as offered by St. Luces caps. 
>
>   We entrust Ambassador Morin with two gifts to offer the Lady Chrysofar, one Scroll of Nightmare Protection and one Portable Oracle machine. We give these gifts freely as tokens of our respect and sincerity. Please deliver the gifts *before* negotiations begin with the Lady of Crosswinds. 
>
>   Go swiftly. Return with the WIND.
