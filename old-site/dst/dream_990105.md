# the council



kids and their toys

######## 
You are seated behind the right shoulder of a blonde woman. She sits at a nine-sided table. There are eight others sitting at the table, four men and four women. Each has a companion seated behind and to the right. Some companions are taking notes on paper. Others are wide eyed, like tourists. None of them are important *er per’ henne* in this place at this time, except for the man behind the Wallachian Prince: Vlad Callion.

 
Directly across from your mentor’s chair sits  [petros](petros.md) , the Prince of Wallachia. His aid Vlad Callion is the Captain Commander of the Port Suame City guard. 

 
Clockwise sits the Firelord, as second councellor in this session. He is Salt Peter, the father of that  [maja](maja.md)  woman of Port Suame. How odd that his daughter is a human, and he wears the flesh of faerie elfar.

 
The third councellor is from the Isle of Sleep, a Dark Childe. If * [hermione](hermione.md) * sees you, you will be found out. You lean back in your chair, hiding behind the head of your mentor. It is good *she* did not arrive after your mentor.

 
Next clockwise sits the fourth councellor, a dead lady. She is dressed in green, the same rotting dress she died in, and has she’s worn for the last two centuries. Her necklace is new: looks like polished white teeth. Perhaps they were once part of her ex-lover’s head.

 
Next to your mentor on your right is the fourth councellor, a man you do not know: he is **er per’ henne**, has never died, and has never been psionically aware. He has, however, had the eyes burned from his face with a hot poker. The scars are interesting in profile. He wears robes, which can be deceiving.

 
Your mentor, Champagne of Twelfth Dream, is the sixth councellor. She thinks you are a Darkling Illuder, and expects to be deceived, making things easy for you.

 
 [sharra](sharra.md)  sits to the left of your position in seventh position. You are certain she does not recognize you.

 
Next is the Archdruid Heron, who once slew your brother and two sisters over who could protect an *Iahklu* better. Obviously his claim was superior, but the inconvenience still rankles. *Who does he think he is, Lady Kannon? Self-righteous druids*...

 
The ninth member of the council is that  [morgan](morgan.md)  of mixed-lios heritage. She never looks at The Firelord directly, and he never looks at her. She is thoroughly cloaked from your psionic perceptions. When you first saw her enter, she smiled at you, and held a finger in front of her lips. She is unknown, but at least she keeps your secret.

|  Half-lios Woman   |  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  |  Dark Childe                  |                       |   | 
|  Archdruid Heron   |  Dead Lady                       |                               |                       |   | 
|  Sharra Decameron  |  Lord Barrett the Blind          |                               |                       |   | 
|                    |                                  |  Champagne of Twelveth Dream  |                       |   | 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lord Barrett raps a wooden hammer on the stone table. “The Burgundy Council is in session.” He glares at Lord Petros. “Now what is more important than this Kayleigh woman who bears the emperor’s child?”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “It’s still not proven to be his.” says the dead woman in green.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Kayleigh plans to retire to Bird Keep,” says the half-lios who knows your secret. “You—we can’t reach her in an  [abelard](abelard.md) .”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “We have over seven months to deal with the High One’s heir,” says Salt Peter. “There are more pressing matters in contention.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Seven months to kill the child, you mean,” says your mentor into her hand. Sharra turns her head slightly and kicks your mentor’s leg without changing expression.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “What of the matter of Crimson Grey?” asks Vlad Petros. “This councillor has evidence that he’s been initiated and commands full Trojan powers.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The council falls silent. Heads turn and expressions change. Shoulders shrug.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Who initiated him?” asks Salt Peter, leaning forward. “Annie is not fully initiated herself, and  [lillith](lillith.md)  is no longer kindly disposed.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Lilith” says the Dark Childe seated next to Salt Peter. 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Lilith is engrossed in her vengeance against Maeglin high-Carsultyl. She’s not training *anyone* in the Pattern.” This from your mentor, the woman seated with her back to you. You duck behind your mentor so the Dark Elf can’t see your face.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “No one has completed the Pattern since the Cycle of  [dance](dance.md)  began,” says the half-elf woman. Again the chamber falls silent. You count to seven before Vlad Petros speaks.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Regardless of the teacher, I have *proof* that Crimson was manipulating probability as well as bearing Wind powers.” Vlad Petros stands. “will the council recognize the person of Dokken, my personal Ferret?“ There is a minor muttering throughout the chamber. “I assure you, he was already aware of the Burgundy council before this day.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I'm sure he was,” smirks Salt Peter.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Dokken had close combat with the Kimdissi. He reports that the events were so uncannily twisted.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “If you have him here, let him speak himself.” says Sharra. “We’d rather hear anyone but you,” she continues under her breath.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  All faces turn to follow Petros’ aid, Vlad Callion, as he rises and walks to the chamber door. He pulls the huge stone slab and it moves slowly towards him. There is a Dark Angel *at rest* behind the door. You feel the entire chamber tense; everyone but Vlad Petros and Salt Peter seems troubled.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The two grey elves stride softly back to Vlad Petros’ council seat, the Dark Angel remains standing between he and Salt Peter.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “This is my ferret, Dokken.” Petros nods to the Dark Angel, who begins reciting with a flat voice devoid of emotion.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “One companion and I fought with the Kimdissi in the fields of Shando south of Port Suame. The target was accompanied by three lios elfar, a harpist, and two juveniles.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Street Urchins?” The torc wearer raises his left eyebrow. “Sharra, you have been remiss. When did the lios meet Street Urchins?”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “You will see that in today’s report should you ever choose to read it, Lord Heron.” she anwers sweetly. Everyone picks up papers from the able except Sharra. Heron reads aloud.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Last week the lios travelled the city and came home with two Urchin gang members. The children appear to be enamored of the grace and beauty of the lios. I expect they will steal something valuable and disappear back to the gutters within the fortnight...”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “If I may continue?” says Petros. After a moment of silence, he nods to his Ferret. The Dark Angel continues, without expression. 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “The Kimdissi’s companions were not sufficiently armed or skilled to have withstood our ambush, yet they prevailed. The Kimdissi **Transformed** my companion’s Ground **Protections** to naught, and I was overpowered by the harpist and one of the juveniles—”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “*Overpowered*?” asks the Dark Elf.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “They knocked me to the grass and held me there.” The Dark Angel for the first time appears empassioned, irritated. “The harpist grasped my left hand and the child grasped my right wrist and disarmed me. I was held, unable to draw any weapon or use my empty hand skills until after my companion fled.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “And then?” asks Lord Heron.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “They released me.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Released you?” says the lady from the Isle of Sleep. “They capture a Dark Angel and then they just let you go?”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I was asked to vow not to pursue them for a half year.” says the Ferret through clenched teeth.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “This is nonsense—” says the dead lady.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Gods protect us from the good,” says the Dark Childe.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Shut up” says Barrett to her. He glares at the councillors, and points the gavel at the Ferrett. “You may go.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  No one speaks as Vlad Callion shows the Ferret out and returns to his seat.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “And what about the matter of the *weirmoniken*? ” Salt Peter places some oval lensed glasses down his nose and peers at a paper before him. “Tanri Silverharp and Derrick . . . the Dagger?” Salt Peter removes his spectacles and places them carefully on the page. “When I met them they were definitely *Iahklu*.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “So the Lios are joined by not only a Kimdissi Manipulator, but also *weir*?”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  ““What for?” All turn to Sharra Decameron.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Maja gated them in. We . . . have an obligation to Laurien’s memory.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Ah yes, the home coming of the Swan,” says Lord Heron. He fingers his wooden necklace. “Not quite as bloody as the Homecoming of the Fleeter, but just as anticipated.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Dark Childe woman snaps, “It’s not that we don’t care about your coven’s legendary Homecoming. We just don’t care *enough*.“ Lord Heron grunts at her and fingers his torc. The Dark Childe turns to Sharra. “When do you think the Swan will be recognized by their god?” 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “The Lios don’t appear motivated. It’s in the report. They may be waiting for Spring Begins.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Many voices at once:

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Merde!”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Spring Begins? They can’t mean to bring her home in the spring!”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “It’s hard to reinforce a wall that has not been built.” 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “They just don’t realize who they are, and what is their potential.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Lios!” sighs, the dead woman. 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Exactly,” agrees Huron. “They flutter from one flower to the next, admiring the colors,”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “How many are awake?”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “That varies widely. Derrick hasn’t been awake since his ordeal, and—” 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Is Maja recovered?” asks Salt Peter.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Maja will not be recovered until she inherits from her mother.” Shara looks defiantly at the Firelord.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “That is not open to discussion” says Salt Peter.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I was not suggesting such a thing. I *was* suggesting that Maja is quite depressed, and nearly catatoonic compared to her usual outgoing self.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “How long do you expect this to last.” asks Salt Peter

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Maja won’t recover until she inherits.” insists Sharra.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “So then you are on your own,” says Lord Heron.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I've only limited rapport. Besides, if we—”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “We're not asking for rapport, were asking for regular reports,” says Vlad Petros.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “You don’t *read* my fucking reports.” Sharra stands. “We're finished.” She points a shaking finger at Vlad Petros. “Crimson Grey is no threat to you. He barely knows you *exist*. If you raise the damn Council against him before Spring Begins, if you even take out another *contract* on him, I'll take apart your precious dragon and **Destroy** each bone, one by one, while you watch.”

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Sharra,” begins the Firelord, rising.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “Sit down!” she yells, red heated air flowing from her finger to splash on the Firelord, forcing him back to his seat as if she pushed him. The hair on the people standing behind disappears in a stench, but the Firelord merely sits upright in his chair.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I reject your council. I reject your petty manipulations and your narrow world view.” She takes a pendant in her hand, and yanks the chain so that it breaks. She clenches the gold pendant in her fist, shaking it first at Vlad, but also then circling the table with her attention before she continues. 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “I would rather be slain while I’m weak, than have you—*you hypocrites*—stand by and watch. You don’t want anyone to know you exist? You're more concerned with secrecy than doing the work this council was founded for. *There aren’t any Dancers that care about us!*”




 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lord Barrett hammers the table. Sharra glares at him, walks behind you to stand at Barrett’s side, and places the pendant on the table before him.

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  “There aren’t any Dancers who care about the council. None but me.“ She releases the pendant. She whispers to Barrett, but you can hear: “And I’ll come back only if you cross my path before Laurien’s homecoming.”




 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Sharra Decameron uses a psionic discipline to **Remove** herself from the chamber. 

 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You wake up smiling.
