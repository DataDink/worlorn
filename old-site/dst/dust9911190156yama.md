 time to strike

>   That's my boy. Let's go for it before the next PC adventure. A Fountainhead 3000-soldier army to overrun Lartroxia east, while the Dry Land forces of 3000 overrun Lartroxia west. Machiavelli on the Necrodemian throne. I like this plan. This leaves more than 50% of our armies available undeployed for unforseen emergencies, while fielding an army that can demolish 7777 bronzers even in their prime. 
>
>   Deployment of 3000 men through Billykins turf gates is not a good idea. A soldier with turf is no soldier anymore. Besides, Rogue DM might not tolerate you using Father Damian's points deposited within your Turf to pump up our armies, but you can try. Damian is, after all, retired while you are an active PC, and the Rogue bills himself as benevolent to PCs. Remember the points need to be spent, and since your own Sentient also runs Garfield, that leaves only the Rogue to buy Billykins/Compass Mountain abilities from. 
>
>   As a Great Smith, I'm supplying Redsteel weapons for both 3000-man armies, including 6000 Gorm's techno 38 caliber handguns with Redsteel hollow-point percentile bullets. I love your idea about equipping the armies with Billykins elven chainmail, but we should invent a Worlorn name to keep the Worlorn Elf Deities off our asses. Made by elven slaves-"Slavemail"? I can have my Mines work fast enough to equip 1700 officers from both armies (850 each) with Slavemail of +12 redsteel, for a base AC -7 to each officer. 
>
>   While Dry Land is churning out Redsteel weapons and armor, please make certain you make 6000 of those conch shells Binding Dust Winds harmlessly. If they are not available to both armies, this may be a short war. 
>
>   Quick Question: Is your army 1 hit die mind flayers with tentacles or zero level Florentine humans with jade skulls? I'm leaning towards zero-level Khansmen with Jade Skulls myself. We have the right to make armies in our likeness; in Troad we might as well use the probability advantage, since we'll always get the bad press no matter what we say. 
>
>   Book of the New Day won't apply to zero level humans the way it would equip one in 20 monster mind flayers with their due. I think I recall Deathgod soldiers can get Ivory Flying Elephant Knives. Fountainhead mind flayer soldiers could take advantage of the Grey Lord name overlap. 1/20 of your 1-hit die monsters equipped by the Compact is pretty keen if all 3000 soldiers get to set down dice. 
>
>   With Simon Almustafa off who-knows-where, and Blood killing significant Dreamers, and Dust killing all Dancers, there's no in-Troad emperor to hold things together when our no-experience armies attack. things will be different when the PCs adventure again next Thursday.

>   P.S. Watch the numbers in your army carefully. You'll want to keep replenishing Troad when your numbers drop below 3000. A plague has been troubling your eastern Lartroxia coastal cities since early 1998. The Troad PCs are all wood elves or deepwoods types who have been ignoring civilization, so you need to clean that up yourself.
