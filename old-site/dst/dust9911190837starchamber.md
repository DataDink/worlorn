 Theseus

Theseus 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  I have spent the night in prayer, fasting and searching for the will of Shal Omnis. She is very happy, Theseus, with you and surely you will be blessed. Accept the offer of life reborn in Sanctuary. Your initial feelings were correct. Please communicate the response on behalf of Shal Omnis to the Holy Blood Phoenix. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  You have done well my friend. Continue the work. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  For me, I must continue to fast until I discover the mother's will ... there is so much more I can do for her ... I will return to you soon my friend.
