THE TRAVELLER





 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller god is the master of the Kav Elfar (Cave Elf) race. He is also known as "X," the name he uses when manifest in avatar. In high council, he is known as  [FIXME: wielder](wielder.md) , honoring the Ironjade kethi (holdfast brothers) above the others: Glowstone, Braith, Taal, Shanagate, Kenn, Coalblack. He, of course, appears as a Kav Elf, known in some lands as Grey or High Elf. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller's avatar plays a unique musical instrument, a shiny lyre-like "champagne"-blue instrument called a "guitar." He dislays great talent with this and any other musical instrument he has been seen to play. He sang many powerful songs with widespread and long-term effect, including: 

* **Tune this Electric Guitar** - changed Heward's Mystical Organ into the Traveller's champagne blue guitar.
* **Gold Dust Woman** - created Helen the Dark from a hair of Helen of Troy, at the request of Aeol, the Dark Smith.
* **Eye in the Sky** - Played for the benefit of  [dira](dira.md)  in exchange for his eye.
* **Magic Bus** - created the Traveller's chariot.
* **Madman Across the Water** - Played for the Demonlord on the Forbidden Isle. Motivation and response unknown.

 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  When seen in battle, the Traveller is reputed to wield a sword of great power, decorated with a ruby, thought to be the evil Snake god's eye. When the Traveller's avatar pulls the ruby away from the hilt, it dangles from a mithril chain which retracts slowly. The sword sings for a time, as the chain retracts. When the chain has retracted fully, the ruby rests again in the setting of the hilt, the sword falls silent. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller rides the Magic Bus, a Prismatic-covered horseless chariot called a "VW microbus" by the god. He created it with a song and a hundred pounds of english chocolate. From the outside it appears to seat a half-dozen persons, but while it is always crowded, the magic bus is never full. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller's concubine/wife is  [FIXME: weilder](weilder.md) , a master thief and founder of a sword school. They met when the Dean of the Wisard Schoool at Isuame and the Chromatic dragon joined forces with them to re-establish the Empire of the Imperial Orb, with Necrodemus I on the Throne. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller's avatar is often seen in the company of the founder of the Trojan Hektorite Crusaders, and is known to favor the Church of Troy in many matters. While the Traveller has aided persons from all walks of life, the god is known to stand neutral in most affairs, acting only when compelled to restore balance in a greatly irregular situation.

THE TRAVELLER’s PEOPLE





 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  In the previous cycle, roughly between 150 and 4594 years ago, during the Time of Fire and Demons, the elfar race deviated from being one people. The sky spewed fire and strange beasts walked the earth. The slaver races became extinct, as did most of their slaves. It was a time of great danger and upheaval. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Those who would become known as the Lios Elfar would not give up their sky, and so retired to the Forest Within the Forest. Those who would become known as the Phoenican Elfar retired to The Fountains of Paradise, a land on the other side of the seas. Those who would become known as Faerie Elfar danced with the demons beneath the fires from the sky (and became much changed thereby!). 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Those who would become known as  [FIXME: race](race.md) , the Traveller's people, retreated to cave-like fortresses called Holdfasts. Because their population had been so depleted during the fighting years before the retreat, the Traveller's people held their childbearing women safe at the back of the caves where they could be found by no demon or fires from the sky. Only the expendable men folk were permitted to travel outside the caves. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  To prevent holdfast infiltration by solitary mockmen (shapechanger demons) the Kav Elfar menfolk would venture forth only in pairs, each man permitted to return to the Holdfast only in the company of their blood brother, called "teyn." Teyns would vouch for each others' identity, a tradition which continues to this day. Kav Elfar society and sorcery became highly attuned to the detection and elimination of shapechangers. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Within two generations keeping the women safe in the back of the caves became a social norm, leading inevitably to a second-class citizenship comprised of females and boys below the age of maturity. The kethi of John Coalblack buried too deeply and the women revolted under the beteyn Eclavdra, she who became the first Queen of the Drow. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Travel in the time of Fire and Demons was limited. The holdfasts were geographically isolated and eventually the distances caused great suspicion which induced civil war. Women from other Holdfasts were often war trophies, obtained on raids to increase the gene pool of the kidnapper's people, and the honor of the kidnapper.

THE ROAD





 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Traveller eventually created his stone roads to magically speed the journey from one holdfast to another, and to magically protect the journey from the fires in the sky. However, the warlike habits of the Kav Elfar were ingrained into their society already, and have not changed significantly in the times since the Road was built. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  At one time Road Travel was available to anyone who dared set foot on the black stone. Each person who travelled the Road was guaranteed only one encounter on the way to one's destination, regardless of the distance or time. Those who travelled in parties were allowed to aid each other in the encounters of  [openroad](openroad.md) , sharing each encounter's risks and benefits. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The guaranteed single-encounter magic was broken if the Road was left. When it was discovered that the magic of the Road could magically starve a traveller if not enough food was carried, Huery-que-que, a pellinese Orc once employed as Royal Chef of Wallachia, created a series of inns called "Country Kitchens" spaced precisely at one-day intervals at a healthy man's foot speed. Inexpensive and well-seasoned food is available for all races but elves, who must pay "a million gold" for each meal, enforced by magic which enslaves non-payers. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  For the last two hundred years the Road has been maintained by a human Priestess Mary-Margaret Roadgrader, who rides a horseless chariot, stranger in appearance than than the Traveller's. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Legends indicate that originally the Road provided only magical travel. In current times a Priest of the Road is required to invoke the miracle of Road Travel. Without such a priest, merchants and vagrants use the black stone path for navigation and comfort, although the prevalence of brigands make this not without risk. Rumors of bonze travelling the road without aid have died out with the teachings of the bonze. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  There is evidence that the gods themselves use a  [goldroad](goldroad.md)
