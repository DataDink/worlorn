# dust in the wind



 Full frontal assault NOW if you would be so kind

 >*I received a message form Chrysofar about our upcoming coup. 

 >Did you mention this to her?* 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Not I. Perhaps her Dust archetype is detecting the affiliation to her that is required of my role as Deathgod. Perhaps this Dust activity is informing both Blood and Dust. Perhaps that 4-armed Blood host is listening too. After all, we are the most Dusty personalities that have never hosted the Archetype, you and I. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Then again, perhaps she heard her name on the Wind. Why, she may be listening to this very dialogue. Best never to use her name. I'm certain we can think of an alternate identifier that fits her personality and impact on Worlorn. How about BreakWind, for example?

 >*strike by this sunday, so we can get ourselves entrenched deep by next play.* 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Dry land has already invaded New Troia; I thought you had begun also. In addition to misunderstanding your caution, I wanted to put my army in place with the Death Star over Port Suame before Tanngrisnir and Phoenix confirmed rebirth for any PCs. The next player character action is S-State at lunchtime today, 12:30 PST Friday 11/19. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Please join me today. Send your Florentines with sufficient extra Binding shells and feather chariots for equipping my Khansmen. The next D-State game may be as early as Saturday, but there should be more S-State Friday night. I strongly urge you to join me ASAP, before any PCs can intervene. A *fait accompli* "Bloodless" coup without PC defenders is more effective than a head-on war. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  About supplies: it was absolutely a fantastic idea to recall everything from your personal colored-card distributions. Our longtime followers may be momentarily annoyed to have to reapply to get their Death and Binder items, but now we KNOW anyone with a Death or Binder item is loyal as of today. You are a crafty thinker, my son, my President. Governor of Lartroxia suits you. Necrodemus Emperors were wimps. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Here are sufficient Dry Land redsteel armaments for 3000 Florentine soldiers: rapiers, slavechain armor, and left-handed Flying Elephant Knife ivory daggers. I'll arrange my army to set up a supply chain to receive their Binder items on the Troad side. Have I forgotten anything?

Yama Dharma, Worlorn's Deathgod.
