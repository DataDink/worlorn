 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Emperor Necrodemus I recognized seventeen Great Lords to found seventeen fighter orders so that his empire would not be so easy to overthrow as it was to establish. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Originally the seventeen Great Lords acknowledged Necrodemus and drew on the Imperial Orb as the source of their powers. Within the first decade of the empire, other Great Lords established fighting orders without Necrodemian blessings. The skill of the renegade orders was undeniable, so Necrodemian Law eventually permitted any honor weapon to be displayed in public, regardless of the nominal fighting order. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  After gutting the redsteel mines of ore, the Emperor executed the Holdfast leader Nirren along with his highbond council. Necrodemus appeased the surviving Kav Elfar holdfasts by recognizing Holdfast Blades (longswords) as Honor Weapons within Necrodemian Law.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The necrodemian fighter is given his first sword, the *i*, upon joining the order. No pledge or fealty is required, although the weapon will be retrieved if the warrior dishonors his house or order. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The warrior achieves two-sword status, and is given the *mai*, when two things have occurred. The warrior must train to a certain level of ability with weapons, and the warrior must pledge lifelong service to an entity or organization approved by the fighter school. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The third sword, the *oude*, is earned when a two-sword warrior with much honor within the order has enough skill to consistently defeat a three-sword teacher in duel or battle. No warrior has achieved three-word status who has pledged to a lord outside his own fighting order. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  If the school is lead by a Great Lord with many duties, the Great Lord may give the responsibility of running the fighting school into another's care. This second-in-command is called a *Chondarin*. Such entrusted status is considered to be the greatest honor, even above being a Great Lord. No Chondarin has ever revolted against his Great Lord. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Earning a third sword is not required to teach within most orders, although all Great Lords and Chondarin are three-swords.
