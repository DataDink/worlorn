>   Before her betrayal, Margeaux Escargot founded the Owsla Guild to teach the women who were turned away from the Halls of Ten Bells. No man is taught the ways of the Owsla Thief. 
>
>   From a remote mountaintop chateau, Margeaux ruled her organization with magical omniscience. Many legends are told of a *Womb Room* with clairaudience and clairvoyance into the guildmistress’ chambers in each of the Owsla guild halls. 
>
>   Each Owsla guildmistress is said to wield an Owsla ring bearing the powers of the Wind. It is known that nine Owsla guildmistresses are mortal women doomed to die, seven are dwarven queens in halls of stone, etc.

>   After Margeaux Escargot met her Real Death by Michael Donn’s  [morganti](morganti.md)  blade *Shadowdancer*, her nightmare, Kiera the Thief, took over the Owsla Guilds without telling anyone. It was near this time that the Superthief guild was founded by Acreon, Hermione e’Helen, and Andromache [*Unlike “Kiera,” these other three known master thief names are dangerous to speak aloud*. -Ed.].
