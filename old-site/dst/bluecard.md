### **blue card strange attractors**



god magic





 
#### 



#### **power**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) a **blue card** represents the ability make an item of divine power inspired by a specific named deity.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) in the cycle of  [dance](dance.md) , **blue cards** make items from chaos. in the cycle of  [dreams](dreams.md) , **blue cards** made items from nothing: from the void, *ex nihilum*. in the cycle of  [history](history.md) , **blue cards** made items from memories. in the cycle of  [astronomy](astronomy.md) , **blue cards** made items from meteors. in the  [comedy](comedy.md)  **blue cards** made items from  [game](game.md) .

 
#### 





#### **perfection**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) a **blue card** represents the ability to make items which perfectly serve a deity. manifest **blue card** attractors are therefore among the middle order of white cards.

 
#### 





#### **consistency**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) **blue cards** make white card items which have guarantee of performance in all places and all timeframes. The divinely inspired whitecard may function in your favor, it may function in the favor of your enemy, but it will invariably function in the favor of the deity inspiring that whitecard.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) only the will of the inspiring deity may alter the manner in which a white card operates when that white card comes from a **blue card**. local conditions (i.e. "circumstances") and the whims of local dominators are immaterial during the invocation of a divinely-inspired white card attractor made from a **blue card** attractor.

 
#### 





#### **multiplicity**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) multiple white cards may be generated from one **blue card**.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) multiple **blue cards** may not exist representing one particular type of strange attractor. 

 
#### 





#### **dismissal**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) a **blue card** wielder may not dismiss white card attractors. a **blue card** wielder may petition the inspiring deity to dismiss white card attractor(s) inspired by that deity. ALL white card manifestations of **blue card** strange attractors are controlled by the deity inspiring the white card attractor.

 
#### 





#### **sectarian relics**



  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) certain **blue cards** are permanently dedicated to a deity or moral code named on the **blue card** as part of the item name. no deity or dominator may alter the inspiration of a **blue card** naming a deity or moral code.
