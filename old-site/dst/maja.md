 Swefen *Er-per’henne* of Port Suame
>
>   Maja Barusse is the daughter of Salt Peter. She was raised as her father found the time, into the ways of a  [necrodemus](necrodemus.md)  mage and priestess of Brilliance. When her father passed on, she inherited his estates and position as Dean of the Wizard School in Port Suame, which she declined until her twenty eighth year. By her own dogged perseverence she rose, despite political resentment regarding her qualifications, to become the Highest Priestess of Brilliance, and Keeper of the Port Suame Telesterion. Only as High Priestess did Maja Barusse accept the mantle of Dean of Necrodemian Wizards. 
>
>   Maja spent considerable time in her youth traveling with the fallen lios elfar Queen, Laurien of the Swan. Their travels covered much of the Lartroxian continent over the sixth and seventh decades of the Necrodemian Empire. Laurien and Maja continue to spend as much time together as their separate worlds permit. 
>
>   When another childhood friend and fellow student of Salt Peter,  [sharra](sharra.md) , returned to Port Suame on duty as a  [roke](roke.md)  Wizard, Maja collected sufficent legends to recover the *Go Rin No Sho*, the elemental control rings that are the  [greatworks](greatworks.md)  of the Archamge Ged. Ring of Water. Sharra bore the Ring of Fire,  [petros](petros.md)  bore the Ring of Wind, and Lord Heron the Archdriud of the Trees bore the Ring of the Void. It is not recorded who Maja chose to reward with the Ground Ring.

>   It is said that Maja Barusse has known multiple exclusive timelines.

|  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) On one, a timelord named Mervyn accompanied Maja and Laurien for more than a few years. It is said that Mervyn preferred the company of Maja over that of the more comely elfar queen, although his attentions were not shunned by either woman. It is known that Maja Barusse does not particpate in discussions of Mervyn the Time Lord, and often leaves a room in which such conversations occur.  |   |  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) On another timeline, Maja Barusse grew up in Salt Peter’s Estate with Derrick Almustafa, both knowing eventually they would inherit their overlapping Places of Power from their parents. ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Childhood rivals eventually became childhood sweethearts, and the pair were bound in marriage soon after both had inherited the [dragonbones](dragonbones.md) of Land Law.  |
