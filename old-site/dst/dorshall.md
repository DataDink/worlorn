# dor shall

a letter of introduction

Solar
 Brein speaks for this one before you, Dor Shall.

 Student of honored Thorizen, he boasts a strong voice capable of learning many songs. Dor Shall sung to me with the Midnight Sword, for his teacher lives no more. Coriander assures me Thorizen gave the Midnight Sword to Dor Shall's care. Many of us still weep ivory. 

 Please be aware. Dor Shall was not among Brein when Thorizen spoke his last. Dor Shall has not yet begin to mourn. It seems to me you may know of special guidance in this regard.

 Thorizen has granted this young Bladesinger leave to take up Brein’s Midnight Sword. The wine of Quaal and Swan must be shared when Brein’s cup is broken. You have my leave to pursue Mollon no more, but instead seek Mikael of the Swan. My ears ring thinking of the Ivory sword Ivory speaking to Midnight and Oak both. Swan and Brein and Quaal harmonizing in my own time.

 Please believe I would have sung this quietly to your ears. For I remember Thorizen.

 Q, Cherished, when you are able, please come home. 

 Tell your mother what you have heard.

 Pyethorne is dim without your song.

 It has been so very long, daughter.

 I would unsay anything for your return.
