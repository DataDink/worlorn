Someone please set these people straight on what happens to non-name level
characters who get hit with Red Light. D'ya think EVERYBODY goes to
Hissarlik???? No, no ,no. Would be verrrry crowded there if that were the
case. I think puddles of blood are just as dead as piles of dust, and if
you don;t believe me, go jump in Vlad's Moat and check it out for
yourself.  I had this problem with an arm, once, that turned to Blood and
it was pretty useless.
