# Peter Abelard



 Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man

![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  After suffering indignities at the hands of his lover's family, Peter Abelard went to  [roke](roke.md)  to learn magical powers to grant him sanctuary from his persecutors. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Abelard learned Ground Powers from the Ground Ring. No Weapon could harm a being standing on the Ground of an Abelard Sanctuary. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Abelard learned protection from the Blue Star of Preservation. No spell or power of less than Mithril Rank could harm a being Preserved within the boundaries of an Abelard Sanctuary. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Abelard worshipped the  [mestea](mestea.md)  of the goddess  [shalomnis](shalomnis.md) . No miracle or relic sourced by a Worlorn deity could harm a being cradled in an Abelard Sanctuary. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Abelard founded a commercial enterprise called Groundstar to accumilate wealth for funding his ongoing research into safe places. For a fee, Groundstar provides bodyguards and magical protections. Abelard's focus was on safe daily living against all odds, rather than at mobile protections for the adventurer. Abelard guaranteed his sanctuaries would persist as long as he lived. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  As time passed, the powers of an Abelard Sanctuary grew. Peter invariably returned to past customers of Groundstar and envigorated their Abelard Sanctuaries, maintaining even the first tentative Abelard Sanctuaries, those cast for coppers on trivial huts or shrines, empowering them all with the full potency and benefits of his latest research. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Groundstar was taken over by other personalities, but they wisely retained the indefinite ongoing services of Peter Abelard. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [halfelven](halfelven.md)  retained the services of Abelard to create the 361  [lifehutch](lifehutch.md)  of his  [greatworks](greatworks.md)   [hissarlik](hissarlik.md) . Troy paid Abelard with FaerieBlood of eternal ageless immortality, as well as immortality from all weapons but the seven Vorpal blades of Worlorn. 

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Peter Abelard is said to be researching these Trojan gifts as well as the knowledge of Blood Magic he gained developing the Life Hutches, in order to deliver Mithril Rank protections to lesser residents of any Abelard Sanctuary.
