Subject: a vision of er per'henne

```
>
>   A Darkling gnome sat on a hilltop with a view of the city to the north. He sat on a square of cloth also occupied with the remnants of a meal and a wineskin. As the primary sun touched the horizon to his left, he adjusted his baseball cap so that it was fully backwards over his long blonde hair. When Red Light fell a moment later, he smiled, and began brushing crumbs off his black silk robe. 
>
>   The small man started wrapping the meal’s debris into multihued squares of cloth he had piled next to his pack and harp. Each hunk of cheese and loaf of bread, each piece of fruit or jerky went back into a cloth. Sometimes the man would look at a cloth intently, or smell it before assigning it a burden. There were enough kerchiefs and two extras when he was done. The cloth bundles he put into leather pouches, and the pouches into his backpack. He sniffed the two unused kerchiefs and shrugged, folding them before stowing them in a belt pouch. He slung the pack on his back and gave the scene a once-over before snatching the handle of his harp case. Once free of the picnic, the huge groundcloth shrunk swiftly to the size of the man’s hand. The Darkling put this in his pouch, too. 
>
>   He stood looking over the city for almost a minute. 
>
>   �It’s a tough job, but somebody’s got to do it,� he said to the city under the pink sky. 
>
>   * * * 
>
>   By the time the farmlands gave way to buildings, and dirt roads to paving, the Darkling had a small entourage of children. They laughed and sang in unison when they weren’t near him, and reached out for his food when they were close. To each child the man asked a question, and for each answer he awarded a cloth bundle. Many of the older human children towered over the gnome, but none of them pushed or shoved to get closer to the man, nor did they attempt to steal his food, or bully for the food he had given to smaller children. 
>
>   By the time Red Light gave way to true night, no children accompanied him. The Darkling’s pack was near empty; he had exhausted his food, and presumably his questions. 
>
>   He took no direct path through the city. He seemed to wander up one lamplit road and down the next dark alley without purpose. City watch nodded to him whenever his path crossed theirs, but despite his dark accoutrements, he was never challenged. 
>
>   Near the wharf, the Darkling stopped in one bar for a drink, and then another three piers away just to listen for an hour from a dark corner. An hour later he stepped into a third brightly lit pub with a piano, and the crowds greeted him by name, and with smiles, and free drinks. When his humility failed to protect him from the crowd he coaxed a love song and two ballads from the piano. There was polite applause after each number, but everyone present rose to his or her feet. After relinquishing the piano to the scheduled minstrel, the Darkling remained in this pub for an entire watch, chatting in turn with each of a long string of people visiting his table. 
>
>   After midnight, and before stopping at a forth saloon, he paused under a street lamp by an alley, and listened. After a moment, there was a sound of ripping cloth and a moan. The Darkling whistled a piercing note. Moments later two kav elver emerged, and fixed the Darkling with a glare. One smiled and slowly drew his longsword, his eyes glittering in the moonlight. The other grasped his companion’s wrist, hissing, �The High One’s Harpist.� Both kavs then withdrew into the night. 
>
>   The harpist stood his ground. A few grunts later, a dark haired woman emerged into the lamp light. She paused, holding up her torn vest with one hand and a golden dagger in the other. The harpist cleared his throat, but she shook her head side to side, stuttering, �Nothing. It’s over. There’s nothing more.� 
>
>   �OK,� whispered the harpist slowly. �How badly hurt are you?� 
>
>   �I’ll live till dawn.� She sheathed her dagger and rubbed her shoulder before starting to tie her torn clothing together. 
>
>   �What about tomorrow?� he asked. She stopped repairing her clothing, and looked down at the Darkling, and batted her eyelashes. 
>
>   �I’ll tell people that The High One is watching out for me,� she said. The Darkling laughed. 
>
>   �You could be right,� he chuckled. �Can I buy you a drink?� 
>
>   * * * 
>
>   Walking alone in mid-morning light, the Darkling harpist came to a large building surrounded by an iron fence. He walked past it upon the asphalt road. Passing the corner post on the far side, the harpist paused, and turned around. He returned to the gate. 
>
>   Placing his harp on the grass to the side of the road, the Darkling started unlacing the ties on his robe, and unbuckling his belt. He reached into his pack and withdrew a pair of huge denim pants, sliding them under his robe and stepping into their legs. 
>
>   The Darkling paused, nibbling his thumb and looking at the ground. With a deep breath, he grew until he was twice his height. His features shifted to a Ghundian human countenance: ruddy skin, short dark hair, tall but not too tall. His black silk robe became a loose open shirt, and the denim pants fit snugly on his human hips even before he rebuckled his pouch belt. 
>
>   The harpist reached over for his harp, and pushed the iron gate open with it. �Honey, I’m home,� he whispered. He paused, as if expecting some reaction. After a moment, the harpist stepped into the grounds. With lengthy strides he strolled up the asphalt walk, nodding to an old man dancing through martial art forms on the lawn of the estate. 
>
>   When the harpist arrived at the door, he stood on the top step without knocking. His smile faded a bit with each second passing until it was entirely gone. He reached up his hand, waved his fist at the door once, and lowered it. Replacing a somewhat-strained smile, he knocked firmly three times. An old Khannish man wearing a black suit and white gloves swiftly answered the door. 
>
>   �Hello?� the old man asked politely. 
>
>   �Please tell  [maja](maja.md)  that Rune is here to see her.� 
>
>   �Rune?� asked the old man. 
>
>   �Yes, Sir,� said the harpist. �Rune.� The men studied each other openly for a moment. 
>
>   �Please wait in the sitting room, Mister Rune.� 
>
>   �I know the way.� 
>
>   �Yes, Mister Rune,� the old man said. �To your right.� He stepped back and turned, leading the harpist to a double door immediately to the right of the large foyer. The old man pushed open the left hand door and stepped aside. �The sitting room,� said the old man. Rune stood in the foyer smiling at his guide for a moment. 
>
>   �Thank you Jeeves, �Rune said, and stepped into the sitting room. 
>
>   �Mister Rune,� said the old man. �Please call me Anton. Mister Jeeves is no longer attached to this household,� he added, pulling the door shut. 
>
>   Rune looked about the study. The wall across from the double doors had a new hearth of rose quartz, but the ornate windows on the right had the same dusty old curtains hiding the front lawn. The entire left wall was covered in shelving, mostly filled with books. There were two pairs of over-stuffed chairs facing each other by the hearth, and in the center of the room stood a large ornate table with a half-dozen open books on it. 
>
>   Ignoring the large stuffed chairs, Rune moved some books to sit cross-legged on the table. He removed his harp from its case and began humming, tuning the harp to his own voice. His notes were confident and sure, as were his fingers on the strings and pegs. 
>
>   He swiftly had three strings tuned, but that was as far as he got before an Atrean blonde woman pushed open both the double doors. She wore a plain blue dress beneath an unfastened robe of white feathers, and stood in the doorway, holding the doors wide, leaning slightly forward from arrested movement. She looked rapidly to the chairs on the right and left, until she saw Rune on the table. A golden sun pendant swung back and forth on her neck. 
>
>   Rune rose to his feet, laying his harp flat on the table. �Maja,� he said, smiling. 
>
>   �Scoundrel,� she accused, hands on her hips. �You could have sent word last night. I was told you played at the Happy Toad most of the night.� 
>
>   Rune shrugged. �Three songs.� Louder: �Only three songs.� He stood before her, stepping to her and threading his arms through hers to hug her tightly. 
>
>   �I would have given much to be there,� She whispered, After a moment she raised her hands and put them behind him. �It’s been so long,� she said. �So long,� she repeated, laying her head on his shoulder. 
>
>   �The High One mourns for your recent loss.� 
>
>   Maja stiffened. She pushed him back to look in his face. �Is that why you’re here, to deliver the regards of the High One?� 
>
>   �And my own.� Rune lifted his hands and put them on either side if her face. �Maja, I’m here because I want to be here.� 
>
>   �Would that he sent his regards more often then.� Her arms fell away, and she turned from him. �How is the High One? Is he really pacing the halls of the Seventh Palace, brooding about the end of the world? Is Kayleigh really pregnant? I mean, against his wishes and with the prophesy and all.� Maja picked up a cloisonn� egg from a shelf in front of her, and rolled it in her palm, studying the multifaceted reflections of the morning sunlight. 
>
>   �She is. We don’t know for certain it’s a son, but she’s fled to the protection of Bird Keep to have the child.� 
>
>   �A willful creature, the High One’s Empress.� 
>
>   �Yes, she is,� smiled Rune. �A willful creature.� 
>
>   �You love her too, don’t you?� Maja asked, looking up from the distraction in her hand. 
>
>   Rune looked away from her then, and touched his harp on the table. �I�� 
>
>   �Don’t apologize. You esteem the High One. It’s natural that you esteem what he values: law, order, and beauty.� She returned her gaze to the egg. �You see so much more of her than you do of me.� 
>
>   �Maja, please.� 
>
>   She cupped both hands around the egg, saying, �Rune, I want you here, now, regardless of the cost. I’ve lost so much, that I need to�I want to have you here.� She stood very still. �Please stay.� 
>
>   Rune walked to her and gently opened her fingers, plucked the decoration from her grasp and placed it back on her shelf. He put his arms around her again, put his head on her shoulder. �I came as soon as I found out.� She hugged him tightly. 
>
>   �I’m angry and hurt and feel so very lost.� 
>
>   �Has your father taken the Time to come back?� 
>
>   �No, but Sharra says Durvail helped defend us.� 
>
>   Rune lifted his head to regard her. �What?� 
>
>   �Sharra was here during the attack, and told me soon afterwards�� 
>
>   �Maja, I think we’re talking about different... please sit down.� His voice had changed, was much more tight and strained. 
>
>   �What?� She looked in his face with curiosity, but no alarm. 
>
>   �Please sit.� Rune pulled a pair of stuffed chairs close together. They sat, and their knees touched, �What do you mean Durvail helped defend? Were you attacked, too?� 
>
>   Maja looked at him with true bafflement. 
>
>   �Rune, I lost my Place of Power when Illithids attacked last Samhain�� 
>
>   �Yes, Maja. that’s old news. I mean,� He looked away from her, out the window. She studied his expression while he composed himself. 
>
>   �What are you... Rune, why are you here?� 
>
>   �The High One wanted me to...� Rune’s voice was rough, and moist. He still would not meet her gaze. �I came here to express the High One’s regrets at the loss of your mother.� He faced her, finally. �Maja, The High One believes that Durvail is dead within the Place of Power, slain within her tower.� 
>
>   She blinked. She stood up, but did not take a step. Rune held her right hand in his left. 
>
>   �That’s. Not. Possible.� She looked around the room, waving her free hand. �It’s not possible. I would have known. I thought your harp won’t let you lie. The strings should break. I would have... I would have inherited. She can’t leave me, too. The strings should break. Where’s Sharra? I need to rest.� 
>
>   �You haven’t inherited?� Rune pulled her arm, and drawing her down into her chair again. �Talk to me, Maja.� Maja’s eyes flitted from place to place throughout the room, resting nowhere for more than an instant. �Maja!� 
>
>   �Where’s Sharra? I need to visit Father. I want to visit Father.� 
>
>   �Maja!� Rune shook her right arm like a jump rope, and grabbed her free hand in his. He tried to meet her eye, but she would not look at him. �Maja, don’t go away again. Stay with me. We don’t want you to go away. You have to stay here. Stay here, Maja.� 
>
>   �Where’s Sharra?� Her eyes were glazed over, not seeing the room any longer. 
>
>   �I’ll get Sharra.� Rune let go of Maja’s hands, rose to his feet, holding his palms out to her. �Stay here Maja. Don’t go anywhere.� The man turned to regard the hearth, and held out his left hand. The ashes and charred wood Transformed into flame. Rune stepped closer, and formally stated, �I summon Sharra DeCameron to this place and time.� 
>
>   A voice like thunder boomed from the fireplace. �Who dares?� Maja tilted her head to the side and smiled, but her eyes remained unfocused. Rune spoke calmly, but urgently, to the hearth. 
>
>   �Sharra, It’s Tirunedeth. Get your ass here and now. Maja is in trouble.� 
>
>   Two flames shot forth into the room, disintegrating into twin showers of sparks. The pinpoints of light formed into two creatures, one dark-haired Khanswoman in orange and red robes, and one taller redhead in chainmail, the latter with long sword drawn and ready. The redhead woman backed up against the wall, lowering her sword but keeping it before her. 
>
>   Rune frowned at the armed woman. The Khanswoman spoke. �Faella, Tirunedeth,� she introduced. To Rune: �Faella is unaware of the legends.� 
>
>   �Thank you Sharra,� said Rune, with a sharp glance. He turned to the redhead. �Hello, Faella. I prefer to go by Rune these days.� 
>
>   �Pleased I’m sure.� said Faella, ignoring Rune’s outstretched right hand. 
>
>   �Sharra, Maja didn’t know Durvail was dead. How is this possible?� Rune whispered, looking at Maja, who was again holding her cloisonn� egg. Maja was oblivious to the conversation, but Faella’s eyes tracked each speaker. 
>
>   �Durvail is dead? Didn’t she...?� 
>
>   �No.� Rune’s mouth turned down. �The High One discovered she died last week and apparently I was the first who informed Maja. It never occurred to me she didn’t inherit. I had the clues, but I didn’t think fast enough.� 
>
>   �Don’t punish,� Sharra said, putting a hand on his arm before moving to Maja’s side. She put her palm against Maja’s forehead, and Maja grasped Sharra’s wrist. Sharra froze. 
>
>   �Sharra,� she moaned, leaning her cheek on Sharra’s arm. �Durvail’s dead. None of the strings broke.� 
>
>   �Yes,� agreed Sharra, motionless. �Stay with us.� 
>
>   �Where’s father? Does he know? Has anyone told father?� Maja’s voice rose. 
>
>   �Stay here.� Sharra patted her shoulder, and shared a glance with Rune. �Remain with us. 
>
>   �I’ve squandered my inheritance. What should I do?� asked Maja, looking up at Sharra. 
>
>   �Find Derrick. Reverse your spell. Don’t leave us,� said Sharra. 
>
>   �We can’t send him back until Tanri sings for Lorien,� countered Maja. 
>
>   �What spell? She found her Derrick?� asked Rune. Sharra shushed him. 
>
>   �Stay here.� Sharra blinked. �Maja, it’s important that you lend me your robe.� 
>
>   �What for?� 
>
>   �I’ll go get Salt Peter.� Sharra pulled her hand from Maja’s grasp and started to remove the feathered robe from Maja’s shoulders. 
>
>   �Yes, someone needs to tell father.� 
>
>   �Lean forward,� Sharra said. �Lift your butt.� Maja complied, and Sharra swiftly pulled the robe from the dazed woman. Maja slumped back in her chair. 
>
>   Sharra held the robe, making no motion to put it on. Maja smiled up at her. �Thanks for coming.� 
>
>   �Of course.� 
>
>   The sound of a gentleman clearing his throat startled everyone but Maja, and all four turned to look. Anton stood in the double doorway behind a blonde woman of mixed lios heritage, with strong silver-grey eyes. Maja stood instantly and strode to the newcomer, left arm outstretched and pointing, right hand brandishing her sun pendant before her. 
>
>   �Get out of my home, you harlot!� cried Maja. 
>
>   Sharra made a squeaking noise. Faella stepped forward with her sword raised, moving to stand between the newcomer and Sharra. However, as Faella passed Rune, he put his hand on her wrist, and held it tightly, shaking his head. 
>
>   �The Lady Morgan,� announced Anton. He quickly withdrew. 
>
>   Morgan regarded Rune from the doorway. �They were promised a man of peace,� she said. 
>
>   �I do wish you would stop saying that,� Rune responded. 
>
>   �Shall I Wish you would start acting like one?� Morgan replied calmly. 
>
>   � �I’ll match you, whim for whim now,’ � Rune sang, softly. 
>
>   �Get out!� Maja screamed, shaking all over with rage. �Get out, now!� Sharra moved behind her, draped the robe over Maja’s shoulders, and started massaging them until Maja lowered her arms. Rune lifted his harp off the table and began strumming his harp. Maja closed her eyes. The tableau held for a half dozen heartbeats. 
>
>   �Your son was so peaceful, he wasn’t up to the job,� said Rune, looking at his fingers. 
>
>   For an instant, Morgan’s eyes grew wide. Closing her eyes and breathing deeply, Morgan replied, �He is what he is.� 
>
>   �Morgan la Faye?� muttered the redheaded woman. Sharra nodded, without stopping her massage. 
>
>   Maja shrugged off Sharra’s hands and stepped up nose-to-nose with Morgan. �Three times I must ask thee before I may slay thee,� said Maja, with precise enunciation. �Get thee gone from my Father’s house, Morganna.� 
>
>   �I built this house for your father, Maja.� Morgan replied. �I gave him the first flag of this Place of Power.� 
>
>   �And then you abandoned him!� 
>
>   �Is that how you learned the tale?� 
>
>   �Ha!� Maja turned away, and began to pace the length of the room. �How would you tell it?� Sharra pulled Faella aside to stand in front of the hearth. Morgan stood her ground, studying the angry woman. 
>
>   Still strumming his harp, Rune wandered to stand with Sharra and Faella. He whispered, �This is better than catatonia?� Sharra grinned. Rune changed his tune to a simple travelling song, and began to hum a quiet harmony. 
>
>   Morgan said, �Salt Peter and I worked together for almost three decades. When our research took us down different paths, we parted ways.� 
>
>   �You mean, when you no longer needed him, you cast him aside,� retorted Maja. 
>
>   Morgan stepped forward into the room, causing Maja stop pacing and the others flinch. 
>
>   �Child, you are impertinent and unwilling to listen, so I won’t waste my breath.� Morgan put her hand in a pocket and came out with four chocolate truffles. She set them on the table. �I have here four flags for you.� 
>
>   The High One’s Harpist muffed a note. He recovered and continued playing. 
>
>   Sharra had stepped forward to the table, as had Maja. Maja extended her hand over to the truffles. After a moment, she lowered her arm to her side and regarded Morgan with pursed lips. Sharra’s eyes glittered in the firelight. 
>
>   �Why?� Maja asked. 
>
>   �Since Durvail was young, even she knew there must be no random chance in Isuame.� Morgan answered. �If the son of Almitra refuses to wield the land law, then the daughter of Salt Peter must.� 
>
>   Sharra pulled her eyes away from the candy to regard Rune. He continued to play his jaunty tune without meeting her eyes. Sharra glanced at Maja, who was regarding the four truffles with her full attention. Sharra lthen ooked at Faella, who was still looking at th e last person who spoke. Maja lifted her eyes from the truffles to Morgan’s face. 
>
>   �Fuck. You. Bitch,� Maja said precisely. �Whatever your game is, I will not be your pawn.� She lifted her pendant saying, �Get out of my home before I paint the walls with your blood.� 
>
>   A tiny smile tweaked the corners of Morgan’s mouth upwards. She nodded first at Maja then at Rune. �Salt Peter’s child or Almitra’s it doesn’t matter which.� 
>
>   Then, regarding Faella for the first time, Morgan said, � Beware, paladin.� Morgan pointed to Sharra, �She’s evil.� 
>
>   Sharra spat, �You little shit.� Faella said nothing, eyes on the last speaker. Faella missed the air shimmering around Morgan, like a mirage on a hot desert road, but later she did notice the charred spot on the floor where Morgan had been standing. 
>
>   Morgan smiled sweetly at Sharra, who was suddenly sweating, and reached out to the nearest chair to steady herself. Then Morgan closed her eyes, a bare instant before her body became a one dimensional black line, that shrank to a point and was gone. 
>
>   No one said anything for a while. �Wasn’t that fun,� Faella finally said. 
>
>   �Fuck-Fuck-Fuck,� sputtered Maja. She picked up the truffles and put them carefully on the palm of her left hand. She looked to Sharra, who was standing, eyes closed, with one hand to her temple and the other still holding onto the chair. She appeared to have been sunburned. �What is her game?� asked Maja. 
>
>   �Welcome back,� said Rune. �Still want your daddy?� 
>
>   Maja glared at him. 
>
>   �I’m thinking I’ll be staying here instead of returning to FireCastle.� Faella patted Sharra on the shoulder.
