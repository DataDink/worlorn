 Klew digs around in his knapsack for his Trump Deck. It's been awhile, but he manages to find it eventually. He flips through the cards until he finds the one for Chrysofar like Auntie Fiona told him to. He concentrates **real** hard for awhile until he feels the contact. 


 "Er, like, hi. This is Brother Klew, of the Open Road. How's it going? My Auntie Fiona showed up the other day and told me I should get in touch with you. See, it's like she gave me this real nice green gem a while back. Then she like show up again and says that it will be important. She says that's what lets me drive the Magic Bus around 'n other good stuff. Maybe she's right, eh?" Klew pauses briefly to take a pull of that good mead Brother Bob brought to his room last night. 


 "I think what she's getting at is that I might be able to make the Bus my Turf, 'n stuff. I think I'd like that." Flowers makes some kind of smart ass retort, but it's hard to hear her from the bottom of the knap- sack. Probably better that way. 


 A knock comes from the door, and Klew gets up to answer it. It's Bob, with a couple of nice young ladies. Klew looks back to the card on the table. "Well, gotta go now. Let me know what you think. And, party on, dude." 


 Just before he puts the card back in the deck, he says, "Oh, yeah, she says to tell you that the nice gem is a Family Jewel. Like, whatever. Be Excellent to each other."
