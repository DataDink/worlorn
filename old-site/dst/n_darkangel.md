>   Remoâ€™s day job was teaching fifteen elves a new class, "Dark Angel." A dark angel was an elvish monk-assassin, with a few extras. By this time Remo had slain the human Master of Summer (15th level bonze) and claimed the title "Grandfather Summer." Dark Angels immediately became nemesis to the normal monk hiearchy, especially the Stealthmasters, but were seen as the elite members of the Darolilm Jedide Brotherhood.
