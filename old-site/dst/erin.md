# erin, the copper fan, betrayer

>   The elf Elrond was a personal companion of  [dworkin](dworkin.md)  in the Courts of Chaos. When he slew his companion Syrinara of the Dusk with the Real Death, Elrond took the name “The Betrayer” and subsequently strode a path well-described by that epithet.
>
>   While claiming to be honest, Elrond took the name Erin to hide behind. Erin claimed to be lawful, yet traveled far outside Worlorn to aquire a Morganti weapon. Claiming to be a friend to all, Erin enacted Necrodemus II’s pogrom of genocide to non-eldren races. With humans on the the verge of extinction, Erin the Betrayer fled the battlefield on the eve of victory and allowed his leaderless Eldren armies to be defeated by mere Stealth Masters and Benedictines.
>
>   Not content with personal and political betrayals, Erin then enslaved and commanded a Wrathman to slay the Lord of Death so that all magic would depart Worlorn. Only the fast thinking and martyrdom of the Buddha  [ko](ko.md)  saved the inspired from being consumed by an infinite army of illithids.

 revelation from Klinure to be Revealed to another dreamer. The Elrond incarnation—and all shared *Swefen/Aquaestors*—were punished with retirement as permanently Abandoned Dreams.

>   It is ironic and unfortunate that Klinure’s nemesis and enemy, the Demonlord Tloluvin, has effectively taken over all the holdings and postions of the Betrayer Legacy with Dorian Hawkmoon, a Nightmare of Erin.

in his own words, and those of others

### From SERGEANTB@aol.com Mon Apr 17 11:20:36 1995

  [eressea](eressea.md) : 

 I am humbled by your  [speech](speech.md) . I once thought I knew what imagination and riteousness were, I am ashamed. You speak to the heart of the matter better than I will ever be able. 

 I know that in your beliefs you feel life is only life if it is lived. I could not find a way to say it better than you have. I will only add that from my perspective life is only life if there is death. Without the converse an existence is constant, and unappreciated, and some would say unprovable, because the contrary could not be said to be true. Life is only life with death. Life is unprovable without death. And as nature has shown, death is part of life, renewing the earth, replenishing the whole, and starting the whole process again. As you said, there is more power in conception and potential for good, than in all of our individual and mutual creations. But what definition would there be if all we did was create, if a natural road to the end of our days was not , at least at some point, part of the process. I would say the creation would loose some of its virtue if the sanctity, the virve, the beauty of life was not to be cherished so strongly. It is just this risk that makes the cherishing, the purity of potential so tangible. I am not saying that taking life is good, or in most senses, proper. I know that you would say in no sense is it proper, but I feel the beauty of a couple growing old together, the joy of watching a child grow into a man/woman, is defined by the aging and wisdom process. While it is tragic that this wisdom is lost at death, if we all survived forever, this beauty would be dulled by the sense of nothing accomplished and repetition. It is newness and challenge and risk that makes life worth living. It is kindness, and romance, and curiosity that define joy and pleasure, and yet even these things over time loose that luster. 

 I say all this because, as you know, I have had to take life occasionallly, sometimes permanently, to defend my own. It is this self-preservation which is part of the chain of life, and the deaths of those persons, while I wish it were otherwise, was done foremostly for what I believed to be honoralbe and good goals. I have erred, as all will, but untimely death is also part of the pattern of life. I would not defend those things, but cannot change them. Even today I own a morganti blade, and I do so to defend my life, to lay claim to that which I have rightfully earned, just as a bear would defend its young or territory. In all things I would choose to do the lesser evil, and strive to, but I cannot say that death is not natural, not even can I say that death is not good. Death means life, and life means death. Life that is not lived is not life, life that is not appreciated is not life either. 

 In all of this, I would say, I will provide you all power I can bring to bear to resurrect Morgan Le Fay. I would be very interested in attending. Though I will leave my blade behind. As much as I choose to own such a blade to keep me from becoming a victim to one, I also do not choose to cause it to be necessary to feed it. I would greatly appreciate any help you might be able to provide that would place this blade in a stasis, so that its hunger could be abated as long as possible. I do not choose to destroy it, however I also do not choose to wield it, except at the most dire of need. I know you and I differ greatly here, I hope you can find somewhere a way to understand my failing. 

 On one final note, I am curious if you would be offended should I choose to use my 'portals' spell. I understand you control trump, and as I own a morganti weapon, I can understand that you would not want to provide me a set, however, I do have some need of communication, and would ask that you allow me to use my spells. I would be most grateful if you could find a way to allow me a card of yourself though. 

 Sincerely

 Erin The Fan

 Thank you most gracious paladin for your generous gift, I will use it cautiously, I would ask to know who is on the deck and the relevant description when you get the time. 

 I will contact the maiden Chrysofar. I will act with whatever discretion you feel advisable. I will update you on my progress. 

 I am interested in establishing a sanctuary for dreamers and their companions at  [elfhome](elfhome.md) . I would like to offer restorative/resurrection capacities, but my only ability is in wishes and psionic healing for which I must be present. I would like to set up a benevolent organization and would appreciate your assistance. If it would not be asking too much, perhaps you could use your ability to resurrect if I am unable, or if it would be more convenient than a wish (to whom I know not who the wishes currently appeal). Please let me know if you are interested in participating.

 Salt Peter, upon hearing of the Dusting of  [threnody](threnody.md) /Llewellyn, says "There was a mage named Erin the something-or-other imprisoned in Llewellyn's place called  [flambeau](flambeau.md) . Now that Flambeau is no longer guarded by Threnody, this Erin fellow might be worth the effort of rescue. Always good to have a dependable Archmage/Great Lord Kin of Troy with probability control and a Vorpal Morganti on your side." Salt Peter snaps his fingers. "Maybe somone should ask Mr. Hawkmoon to do the rescue! That's the ticket!"
