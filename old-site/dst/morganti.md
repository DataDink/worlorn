bringers of real death

### Subj: Threnody's Lists Date: 95-04-23 15:47:53 EDT From: TroyOunces

 Threnody says Maeglin claims that there is only one extant morganti weapon confirmed from the first 21 made by Morgan and Aeol: Dolkris. The ones which were not "awoken by other means" [Maeglin's phrase] were consumed by their own hungers when Yama was slain and the Paths of the Dead fell. 

1. **Anguirel** - Destroyed by the Fire Sermon (will of Maeglin, at Musquel recently) 
1. **Anglachel** - Cancelled by Gorm (THE Black Bunny. Taken from Dark Helen by Llewellyn and delivered to Gorm) 
1. **Lifesbane** - Weapon broken, owner slain (illithid-Hal's suicide, weapon parts with Eressea) 
1. **Blackwand** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon exists? Church of the Mother. Lord Dasher and Roland can best pursue this if desired.) 
1. **Pathfinder** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon exists-Aliera, commonly found at Elfhome. She says the fall of Yama ended her weapon's id) 
1. **Iceflame** - Transformed by What the Thunder Said (will of Odysseus, when he attacked Sethra Lavode Glowstone) 
1. **Black Sword** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon exists? Eternal Champion?) 
1. **Killer** - Unmade 
1. **Widowmaker **- Cancelled by Gorm 
1. **Harenchi** - Unmade with universal solvent (will of Callahan) 
1. **Greenwand** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon exists? Necrodemus VII) 
1. **Wyrmbane the lesser** - Consumed with fall of Paths? (weapon exists? Morgan la Faye?) 
1. **Shadowdancer** - doesn't exist outside of Troad's Shadows (A chance for its morganti ID exists on ALL shadows) 
1. **Dolkris** - "*Redreamed in our time*" [-Maeglin's phrase] by Erin the Betrayer (Proven morganti ID on his recent rebirth. Already claimed two. these are the first Morganti deaths recorded in 30 years) 
1. **Hrathnir** - Cancelled by Gorm/Llewellyn teamwork 
1. **Sword of Kas** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only?; weapon exists? Kas?) 
1. **Kankyo** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon=Coven Angel-exhiled with north pole heir?) 
1. **Maarter Phaal** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only; weapon exists-Vlad Petros, 3rd Prince of Wallachia) 
1. **Terminus Est** - Shattered by Curse of Llewellyn, (Fragments in Novus Mundi, verified personally by Maeglin.) 
1. **Secret Weapon** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only? weapon exists? Mario?) 
1. **IronDoom** - Consumed with fall of Paths (ID only? weapon exists? Nathan Stack?) 

 Maeglin claims Yama's unbroken life was a condition of the existence of the original 21 (dream-20 Tloluvin) morganti weapons, but we'll have to ask Morgan when we see her...Maeglin forgot to ask Aeol before he Destroyed Aeol. 
 The other 666 (Dream-19 Deatherage) weapons are Maeglin's "responsibility." Maeglin swore by the Runestaff he "will see them Destroyed before [he] gives up [his] life or the Fire Sermon." Threnody thinks this oath is foolish, wasteful of resources, and bodes ill tidings, since all of the remaining dream-19 morganti weapons are Immune to Destruction by virtue of living through an attack of Fire Sermon willed by diGriz. But hey, nobody asked Threnody before Maeglin swore the oath. 

 * If you are only shadow-morgantid why does a wu hsin still show up? Are these glitches in reality prevalent in this world or what?? * 

 Maeglin says if you had been shadow-morganti'd then you would still be dead. "That's why they call it The Real Death." There are no reality glitches with Morganti weapons: they work, no matter what. 

 Maeglin says his wu hsin appears on Trump because he was genuinely morganti'd, like Morgan and Aeol; he only 'appears to continue dreaming' any longer. Maeglin's tone of voice discourages questions.
