# dust in the wind



 Troy Number 1, Troy Number 2, or troy number 3

**Damon Maker asked:**

 *Also, I have a question perhaps best put to the maker of rules, what effect does Damon's Making an object (or something more ephemeral) have beyond my immediate realm? * 
 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanngrisnir says this depends on the distribution. if you Make a change to the Compact, then the availability of the item or effect is enforced under whatever Law Damon Makes, at least wherever the Compact is valid. Otherwise your item or effect is subject to local conditions, which vary widely. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Another important factor is that without Crossing-in-the-Mist exposure to Iahklu, (AKA seen by player characters on adventures) a change is usually not widespread or permanent. 


**Damon Maker asked:**

 *What does a dreamer's action do in the cycle of Dance (especially when they are created on my turf, but pass into other places) ? Or is there any point to doing such a thing (or is there great personal risk to it) during another cycle or should I just hunker down and let things pass?* 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanngrisnir says there is a weird BIG JUJU magic effect on Worlorn that Makes all Dancers and Dreamers see only their own kind. A Dreamer leaving your turf would leave and still appear as a Dreamer to himself and other Dreamers while appearing as a Dancer to those who are Dancers. Therefore your people won't be persecuted, unless for other traits. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tann is not sure what Damon Maker means by "Dreamer's action," but he says that there are a bucket of Dreamers in Troad that take actions [every other Thursday] at least whenever they aren't Made into little piles of Dust. (Damon can see that DUST in the WIND Made Tanngrisnir very angry.) 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanngrisnir says that if Damon Maker wants to Make stuff, he can import any of it into New Troad and when the PCs see Stone Brothers and Huldra Folk then they will be certain to see your new inventions. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Lots of Troad Huldra are currently hanging out near the player characters, uh, rebuilding, um, yeah, an old stone castle called Fort Skemandras near Port Suame. This is currently to defend the Port Suame people and vicinity from the invasion by armies from the  [yama](yama.md)  and the  [kalkin](kalkin.md) . In another timeline before the new Oimotan turf setups, Tanngrisnir thinks Fort Skemandras was the fort built by Champion Dwarfgod's people [back in 1992-1993?] to defend against the mind flayers and Watersea invaders. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tanngrisnir says vehemently that Damon should NOT hunker down for the next 4365 years of Dance. He thinks that Damon can get out or stay in, but he should definitely Make himself happy instead of grousing about letting things pass. "Make your life worth living and don't worry about what others think or do. Make a difference."
