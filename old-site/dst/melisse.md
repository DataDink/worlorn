# melisse



death by fire sermon

...what I know about Melisse for sure at the moment is just that she's very very angry. If she were to come back she might just dedicate her life to the total anihilation of all Morganti weapons, whether or not such a thing were a reasonable goal. I've been thinking about what goes through one's mind as one is falling down a shaft towards the center of the earth, hacking away at a  [morganti](morganti.md)   [FIXME: 17](17.md)  that is lodged in one's heart, with a fire sword that one deeply resents having been forced to choose. The thoughts that go through one's mind under such circumstances are not calm thoughts.

*Where exactly is Melisse located right now? What kind of place is it? (I keep imagining Brust's Castle Black or Dzur Mountain because I have nothing else to work with.)*

 

> Dylan Llyr didn't impose anything on Melisse, preferring to observe her infinite control over her turf rather than impose his own designs on her recovery. Therefore, Melisse has created a universe of her own expectations, modified only by Dylan and only when bad thoughts might snowball into worse thoughts.
> 		For example, when Melisse gained the capacity to want to eyeball her surroundings, she may have instinctively created a canopied bed from which she could look out into a stone-walled castle chamber, such as found in Castle Black. When Melisse listened intently, she might hear the noise of mice, or a nurse coming to feed her. When Melisse developed a fear that the nurse was a spy for darkness or evil, Dylan Llyr made another nurse looking much like Melisses's mother to replace that one who was beginning to feed upon angst in Melisse's world view.
> 		It follows that eventually Melisse will begin to fear that she's suffering just another sensory deprivation nightmare, one precisely of her own control. This is the moment, when Melisse forms that thought, when Dylan Llyr _plans_ to introduce himself to Melisse within her environment. He will be certain to appear as a non-controlled, non-controllable element of her world, one which is slightly unexpected, and not at all threatening (if you can imagine _anything_ outside of Melisse's perfect control being nonthreatening to her after she's gotten used to that state..).
> 		Of course this strategy assumes Melisse never before this moment of fear thinks to make herself immune to telepathy....
