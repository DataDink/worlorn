 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  THROUGHOUT WORLORN, DUST HAS JUST SLAIN EVERY BLOOD LAW (SECOND EDITION D&D or ROLEMASTER) CHARACTER THAT BREATHES OR IS TOUCHED BY WIND.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  Tiresias announces "This is a truly evil deed, equaled in all of Worlorn History only by The Demonlord Tloluvin's Red Dawn." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [troad](troad.md)  responds, "All it takes is one Turfholder who is defended under Khitomer to succumb, and the  [khitomer](khitomer.md)  will crush her like a bug." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)   [watersea](watersea.md)  observes, "Very dangerous. You go first." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  simultaneously,  [hell](hell.md)  (male voice) and MELISSE'S FIRE SERMON (female voice) say, "I'm defending her. Try us. I Triple Dog Dare you." 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  The Worlorn Games Authority notes that Surviving Turfholders may "reset" immediately and allow all dead characters no knowledge of their deaths.

 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  And I fully expect y'all to reset. It isn't YOU I am after. It's those Blood folks. And since I couldn't do it with Light, well, we gotta counter that Red light stuff somehow, or be sitting ducks. 


 ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  SOrry for the inconvenience. Don;t you love it when I have PMS and a Rose.

 No. We do not.

 Tell it to the dead.
