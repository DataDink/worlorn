# maja and petros

 wind and water

>    [maja](maja.md)  Barusse pushed the library door open and threw it shut behind her, striding into the room like she owned it. Her long orange and red dress billowed behind her, barely restrained by the white feathered robe. Without regarding the rows of shelves in the middle of the room, she cut right, driving straight for a low shelf under the curtained window. Her bare feet smacked three times on the stone tiles of the library floor before she stood directly before the bookcase. Maja pointed her right hand at the books and had put her right index finger on the spine of one before she lifted her face to the curtains. 
>
>   The window curtains were drawn. Other than the skylight above, the window on the long wall was the only light for this room. There were no torch sconces or candelabras, nor was there a hearth in the library. One could read by daylight or not at all. Raising her face to the skylight, Maja noted the black blanket cover, and spun about to face the room, lifting her right hand from the book to a place behind her ear. 
>
>   She counted five dark figures less than a sword’s reach from her, standing still as death between the first and second rows of shelves. In an eyeblink Maja closed her upraised hand. A golden longsword appeared, instantly blossoming in flames as bright as Sunlight. Maja’s left hand pulled at a chain about her neck, trying to tug her pendant free. 
>
>   Maja faced the figures, not the brilliance she held behind her, so she was able to watch one intruder as he cried out and collapsed, saw his outflung arm turn to dust beneath his cloak and gloves. The man had been over six feet tall, but even so his empty clothing was a long moment settling the floor. His cloak floated down like smoke in a still room. The other figures flinched, all save one, and the tension flared up like her blade, but there was no other motion in the room. 
>
>   "Please, Barusse," said one of the figures, thinly. The speaker was shielding his eyes from the glare of the flames, but with the other hand had lowered his hood to reveal a full head of short grey hair with matching beard. His eyes were vibrant, piercing, the kind of eyes that remain blue, brilliant blue, even under a cloudy grey sky. The other figures had turned entirely away from the light, leaving their hoods on. The spokesman continued, "Put your Holy relic down. If I came to attack, you would not remain unmolested after killing my man." 
>
>   The flames on the sword dispersed with a "thwump" perceived more in the chest than ears. A wisp of white smoke rose from the tip of the blade and was gone. The metal continued glowing with red heat as Maja lowered the weapon. She kept it in hand, but with her body between the visitors and the blade. 
>
>   "You are uninvited, Vlad Petros." she said. She pulled her left hand from between her breasts, face growing red. 
>
>   "Incorrect, Barusse. You invited me here, with my entourage, three years ago to plan for the Five Rings." Petros’ eyes glittered as if the sun shone in them yet. 
>
>   "I rescinded that invitation." 
>
>   "Never in my hearing." 
>
>   Maja nodded, and eyes fell to the empty clothing. "He was not a man. What I did was not a killing. One cannot kill the dead." Her eyes locked again on Vlad’s face, displaying a calmness that contained no regret, no fear, no anger. 
>
>   "He was my friend." 
>
>   Maja inhaled, and tuned her face to regard the covered curtains, the skylight. She spoke without looking at him, changing to Wallachian tongue. Her voice wavered, perhaps from the convoluted honorifics and precise syntax of that tongue. "He was your . . . a friend. I, I must apologize for . . . taking from you one who was your friend, my Lord. What may I do to make things right between us, Lord Drakulya?" 
>
>   The anger on Drakulya’s face cleared as if his emotion was washed away. What remained for an instant was no different than the stillness of a statue or a corpse. Petros’ humanity returned swiftly, a pained look without anger or aggression. "Maja Barusse, I . . . I can think of nothing you could do." 
>
>   "Then I will owe you a favor." 
>
>   Vlad’s expression turned stern once more. "It had better be a great favor, Barusse. He was my . . . my good friend, and a strong leader. Caleb was an Old One from the time of my grandfather, the first Dai Sensei of the School of the Bat, a man and a teacher who inspired much loyalty. He will be missed by all of my people." 
>
>   "Your eulogy speaks to my heart, my Lord. You will discover the strength of my grief on the day you ask me to pay for it." 
>
>   "Yes, I will," Petros said. He sighed a great sigh while closing his eyes momentarily. He opened them and looked all about as if awakening in a strange place. He continued in the Khannish tongue. "May I introduce my entourage to this household?" 
>
>   "You may." Maja relaxed, but maintained her posture, holding the sun blade drawn in her hand, extended to the floor, behind her body. 
>
>   " [chrysofar](chrysofar.md)  the Red, The Quaestor of Wallachia." Vlad Petros lifted his hand above the head of a cloaked woman. She raised red-gloved hands to each side of her hood and pulled the sides back onto her shoulders. The visage was memorable: white hair falling straight down past shoulders on each side of her face, flowing past pale pointed ears indicating Pure Eldren, perhaps Melnibonean, heritage; wolf’s eyes of green crystal with a vertical black stripe on each. A tall red collar showed beneath the black cloak. She smiled, more of a barring of teeth than an expression of goodwill. 
>
>   Maja nodded to the woman. 
>
>   "Akkane, King of the Wind Wolves." Vlad Petros lifted his hand above the head of the only figure who had not flinched at the Light of the Suns. Akkane used two pale white hands to lift his hood and drop his cloak to the ground, revealing a dark-skinned dark-haired Khannish human in buckskin jacket. His pale grey eyes were striking, demonstrating his blood was not exclusively Khannish. Akkane looked at Maja and sighed visibly, holding her sight to his. 
>
>   Maja exhaled at the man, who smiled, causing Maja to smile in return. They held each other’s eyes a long moment, and both smiles deepened. "Be welcome," Maja whispered. 
>
>   "As always," whispered Akkane, nodding and closing his eyes. Maja’s glance turned to Petros, who nodded and lifted his hand above the head of his shortest companion. 
>
>   Vlad paused while she used her long-fingered hands to lift her cloak away from her face. "Kiera, the thief," said Vlad. Her motion revealed the rich brown hair and complexion of an elderly Kav Elfar woman. Her grace and liquid motion reinforced the years that lined her face, darkened her hair. Her many jewels caught the limited light of the room, reinforcing an appearance of wealth and refinement. Her utter stillness and quiet spoke louder than a thousand words. Her longbow and the fletching of three arrows above the cloak were the only weapons visible in the room aside from Maja’s blade. 
>
>   Maja’s smile locked in place. She blinked and said, "*Mi casa es su casa.*" Maja’s eyes had never left the woman’s face after the moment her name was spoken aloud. 
>
>   Kiera nodded. "Thank you. What’s mine is yours," she said. 
>
>   Vlad Petros moved his gloved hand to indicate four chairs around a low chess table. Maja nodded to him. Petros lifted his other hand to his people, who glided over to seat themselves. Neither Petros nor Maja took the fourth seat. Petros stood with his back to the room, arms on the high back of Chrysofar’s chair. They faced the empty chair nearest Maja. On Maja’s left sat Akkane, and on her right sat Kiera. 
>
>   Maja crossed to stand directly behind the empty chair. She continued to hold her body between her unsheathed sword and the intruders, but her wrist relaxed. She held the blade loosely, flat across the backs of her thighs rather than tensely extended away from her body. She leaned her left elbow on the back of the empty chair. 
>
>   "Why are you here?" asked Maja. 
>
>   "I must question Crimson Grey about the Pattern," answered Petros. 
>
>   "Where is your ferret?" asked Maja. 
>
>   "Seeking another family member." parried Petros. 
>
>   "He must be hard to find." probed Maja. 
>
>   "Yes, she is." 
>
>   "Why not descend to the Bat Cave and ask your Bat Oracle?" 
>
>   "Ah, piercing to the heart of the matter in a mere three questions." Petros looked pleased, but the words were bitter. 
>
>   "You have a lot at stake." Maja deadpanned. 
>
>   "My Bat Computer is not accessible." 
>
>   "Why?" 
>
>   "A beholder disabled my collection." 
>
>   Openmouthed, Maja leaned her head forward slightly to regard Petros. When his expression revealed nothing, her eyes dropped to Akkane, who studiously resisted looking to her. Chrysofar’s smile and keen direct gaze had not changed since her introduction. Kiera was playing with a tiny lead soldier, a red pawn from the chessboard, marching it along the arm of her chair. A white pawn was already on the end of the arm closest to Maja. 
>
>   "You were attacked by a beholder?" 
>
>   "Not attacked. She did it only at my most adamant request." 
>
>   "She? Madam Bird?" 
>
>   "Yes." 
>
>   "So you were where she fled. You gave her sanctuary?" Maja paused, eyes looking at the floor, seeing nothing in the room. "Then why? Why on earth would you order her to disable your collection?" 
>
>   "So the Illithids would be unable to use the Bat Computer to answer their questions." 
>
>   "You are scaring me now." 
>
>   "About fucking time, Barusse. I have been terrified to immobility since you were attacked last year. All of us have. Except for Quarma’al, every holder of Land Law I’ve spoken with has been waking up each--day--with one thing on our minds. Who is next?" Petros expression was cold and frustrated, but not directed at Maja. 
>
>   "How much Land Law remains?" 
>
>   "Everyone else is fine. You, Madame Bird and myself were the only casualties when I fled Wallachia last week." 
>
>   "Last week? You took a whole week to let me know?" 
>
>   "I made certain no chance existed that I was followed. They don’t know where I am and no one but me and my entourage knows where Bird is hiding now." 
>
>   "I didn’t need to know that." accused Maja. 
>
>   "Yes, you do. She’s in Stasis. She’ll never waken without someone’s help." 
>
>   "Cowardly bitch!" exclaimed Maja. She put her fist over her mouth, but didn’t appear contrite as she regarded Petros. Petros shrugged, but Chrysofar nodded and Akkane grunted. Kiera had four pawns lined up on each chair arm, but Maja had yet to see her reach to the chessboard. 
>
>   "Damn! Damn! Damn!" Maja pounded her fist on the chair back. "Where’s Kayleigh?" Petros stared at her. Maja asked, "What?" 
>
>   "I came here to ask you." 
>
>   "Me?" 
>
>   "Bird said  [sharra](sharra.md)  came here after the Massacre at Bird Keep. We figured they had escaped together." 
>
>   "Sharra didn’t know." 
>
>   "Where is she?" 
>
>   "Sharra or  [kayleigh](kayleigh.md) ? Sharra’s  [dream_990915](dream_990915.md) . She said Rune said the Empress disappeared as the battle started." 
>
>   "Disappeared?" 
>
>   Maja shrugged. "Sharra said Rune was quite distressed." 
>
>   Petros stood like he needed the chair back for support. "The High One’s Harpist didn’t know whither Kayleigh escaped to? Not even if the Empress survived?" 
>
>   Maja shook her head. She noticed Kiera had paused on her fifth red pawn only when Kiera resumed its quick march along the chair arm. 
>
>   Chrysofar piped up, "Are we toast now?" 
>
>   Petros replied, eyes distant. "Burnt toast, my dear. Charred to ash." 
>
>   Chrysofar grinned. "Red dragon breathes. All three char and die," she said with untempered glee. 
>
>   Complete silence descended in the room. Even to the keenest ears, only Maja’s slow breathing could be heard. Kiera collected both arms of pawns ambidextrously, swept her hands together, and opened her fingers over the the chessboard, upsetting the remaining chessmen of both colors.
