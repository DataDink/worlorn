# gateway

key to astronomy
>
>   Gateway is an asteroid in an orbit around the Hellcrown identical to Worlorn, but 180 degrees apart. The Hee Chee used it for exploration, but abandoned it before the Cycle of Comedy. It is not proven that Hee Chee did more than hollow out tunnels between open caverns. Next time you see one, ask it to stop by Gateway and talk to our company Sages.
>
>   Gateway is the berth and 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0 coordinate for over 600  [dragonbones](dragonbones.md)  voidskimmers of both armored and unarmored variety, with crew capacities of one, three, or five persons. Your voyage may be lengthy, so choose your travelling companions wisely.
>
>   Training as captain or crew for skimmer missions is available for a nominal fee. All survival risks are assumed by the trainee, who must indemnify Gateway from any responsibility or harm, as well as cover all costs associated with training, piloting, and returning the voidskimmer and cargo to Gateway in operable condition.
>
>   Sustenance of biological functions is neither included in the training fees nor assumed as a responsibility by Gateway personnel. Air, water, food and other sustenance requirments desired by trainees may are provided *as is* and for a separate nominal fee by many third party separately liable legal entities licensed to operate within the Gateway facilities.
>
>   Pilot and crew acquire a percentage of all ongoing profits made from discoveries (including all "items, relics, artifacts, supernatural effects, and technologies") acquired while implementing Gateway equipment or training for the full duration, berth to berth, of any skimmer voyage for which they signed up as crew or pilot, and completed successfully in accordance with Gateway rules and customs.
>
>   Those who flagrantly test our rules and customs are expelled from Gateway facilities into the Void regardless of the availability of transporation to other locations or any lack thereof. Transportation to and from Gateway is explicitly not included in the training fee, and is the sole responsibility of the trainee. Voided personnel no longer acquire a percentage of ongoing profits.
>
>   All crew and pilots who acquire a percentage of ongoing profits are expected to maintain a Gnome Account in "good standing" with the Darkling Bank of Wintercastle, LLC., in which all monies and wealth pertaining to the potential ongoing profits may be delivered. Any acquired ongoing profits which cannot be delivered into a Gnome Account on the first attempt by the Gateway Key Foundation because of lack of good standing with the Darkling Bank of Wintercastle will be forefit, and NO further attempt will be made to account for, track, or deposit alleged ongoing profits until the pilot or crew Account Owner can prove the Gnome Account has resumed a rating of "good standing" with the Darkling Bank of Wintercastle.
>
>   In an effort to enable more personnel, Gateway Foundation has purchased equipment suitable for depositing ongoing profits into an Oracle Tab Account approved by the aforementioned Darkling Bank of Wintercastle. Unfortunately during the Cycle of Dance we cannot accept Outbangle Accounts even when approved by the Darkling Banks of Wintercastle, LLC., or the Gnome Bank of Diaspar, Inc. We appreciate your patience in this matter and look forward to doing business with any pilot or crew equipped with an outbangle during a Cycle in which we can more fully meet your needs.
>
>   The average acquired onoing profit per pilot is nearly one million troy ounces of gold per subjective year. The average acquired onoing profit per crew member is somewhat lower. 
>
>    [shelgrim](shelgrim.md)  was the first Inspired creature to set foot on Gateway. Gateway was not discovered or identified in the inane doodling cartography of Celia Marcyan’s wanderlust. What the hell does “Worlorn” mean anyway? Gateway was never seen by Kleronomas, and good riddance to him and his morbid travelling songs, even if he didn't deserve the Real Death, which is debatable. Nor was Gateway discovered by those sniveling kimdissi time-bandit wannabees Tomo and Wallberg. None of them was smart enough, driven enough, or Inspired enough to plot the way and stay the course.
>
>   Gateway was discovered by Shelgrim, claimed by Shelgrim, Named by Shelgrim, and continues to be exploited by Shelgrim on all timelines and continuums. In all places and times, Shelgrim sits on the Board of Directors of the Gateway Key Foundation, maintaining a minimum of 51% "controlling" interest in any timeline or continuum. 
>
>   His share of discoveries recovered by Gateway skimmer crews amounted to over ninety-nine million billion troy ounces of gold *profit* during *each* of the first five Worlorn Cycles, with all monies in excess of one Gnome Account donated to Charity. Charities may apply for donations inperson at the lobby of the main Gateway Facility on the Gateway asteroid.
