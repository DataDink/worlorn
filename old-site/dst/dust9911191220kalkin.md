# dust in the wind

 time to strike

Dearest Yama, 
>
>   Now I see is the time to strike at the Troad Kingdoms. What with the Turf Holders all up in arms over this Chrysofar thing they won't care about this insignificant place. But when all is said and done they always come back there. I have troops ready to attack (hopefully), able to go to any capital in the empire. 
>
>   What I offer is the following. Half of any and all land aquired during any battle. If the empire falls, I would split it half way, you in the west and me in the east, splitting Ensjlos in two, after dismantling the street of the gods, of course. 
>
>   As way of enticement (if one were really needed), I offer to teach you the way of "walking the sewers", an ability I learned on a nameless adventure years ago. 
>
>   Please let me know if you are interested and/or have any ideas on where to strike.
