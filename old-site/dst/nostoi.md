### Threnody on Nostoi







  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif)  [threnody](threnody.md)  says, " [roland](roland.md)  and  [eressea](eressea.md)  and Hektor and I escaped from  [hissarlik](hissarlik.md)  already. We are Nostoi: the twenty  [dreams](dreams.md)  who returned from Hissarlik and will remain in the Wasteland if  [redlight](redlight.md)  shines again.

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "Nostoi don't have to worry about being sent to Hissarlik if we are in one of the 20 non-Hissarlik life-hutches when Red Light Falls. We have outbangles to protect us, to keep us in the life hutches outside of Hissarlik. 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) "It is Justin and  [tanngrisnir](tanngrisnir.md)  and Aliera and Maeglin and Necrodemus VII and Alexander Skemandras and Andromache and all other non-Nostoi dreamers who are name-level that will be sent without appeal to Hissarlik . . . name-level dreams will be found [by Red Light Hours] regardless of the places they hide." 

  ![xparent](assets/xparent.gif) Threnody shrugs. "The  [halfelven](halfelven.md)  and Luces Rojo set up a damn thorough trap. It's almost impossible to hide name-level dreams from Red Light."
