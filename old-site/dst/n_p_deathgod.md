>   The  [deathgod](deathgod.md)  incarnates as a Khannish male. He wears simple red clothing suitable for the place and time of his appearance. His favored weapon is a great axe of iron. He lives in a Ziggurrat of Iron and Obsidian. His looks can kill. 
>
>   To say his name  [yama](yama.md)  aloud invites death. It is an Unholy Word of Power that slays most mortals, even the speaker. Should the speaker of the Name survive the speaking, that person will likely have a gift from the Lord of the Flies in his or her mouth.

>   In addition to managing the  [mortalcoil](mortalcoil.md) , Yama Deathgod is one of the Great Smiths. Inventions that create death are likely to increase the inventorâ€™s lifespan by a decade! 

 [top](#top)

>   Fanatical followers of the Deathgod define evil, intentionally and maliciously shortening the natural lifespan of a creature. Killing and pillaging is the way of life, unless one can make a profit from sale of life or loot. 
>
>   Bloodmasters and Wolfen may be evil, but Undeath is *way* more evil. Undead imitators (such as vampires and werewolves) avoid the  [mortalcoil](mortalcoil.md) , and are put to Death.

>   After conquering the Lartroxian continent for Necrodemus, The Pope of Death Vannik moved back to his high altar in Tranodeli. This placed him farther from political center than her wished, so after quelling his enemies, Vannik placed the high altar to Death within a Dark Cloud Castle, so he could fly his temple anywhere he was needed. 
>
>   Subsequent Popes have domed the castle and removed the cloud, such that the high altar to death now appears as a black sphere. A Firelord gifted the Moff Tarkin a weapon for the castle that shoots a beam of molten iron up to ten miles from the Death Star's position.

>   The current Pope of the Deathgod is Tarkin, a Grand Moff in the Church of Death.

>   The Khannish take their name from the Great Khan, who's Plains Horsemen became known as Death's horde when they conquered Lartroxia for Necrodemus I. The Khannish have swarthy skin, dark hair and eyes. Their women fight along side their men, and are twice as fierce. 
>
>   Khannish and Atrian do not get along as a rule.
