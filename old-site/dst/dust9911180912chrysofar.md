# dust in the wind

 why so bad?
>

```

OK, you guys, someone tell me why this dust in the wind is such a bad
thing when numerous friends and enemies alike have been either turned to
puddles of blood or sent to Hissarlik by Red Light and nobody is
complaining, pissing or moaning and doing a damn thing about it. Really.
If someone else had turned off Red Light then i wouldn;t have had to do
anything. If someone hadn;t invoked Starlight as their gold card i
wouldn't have had to do anything else.
Is the cycle over? Anybody know? Do we run through another Muse now until
we get back to Dreams or can we pick one like Spin the Bottle?
