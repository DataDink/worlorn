### Subj: Judge of the Change Date: 95-05-05 03:32:03 EDT From: TroyOunces

 The change of power at Port Suame is surprisingly easy. 

 Kallion and Lady Moeru are given a warm welcome: the populace of the city line the streets the day of their arrival, and spontaneously turn their arrival into a parade, followed by a general city-wide festival which the Khan Tigris is wise enough to encourage. The Khans donate generous amounts of food, booze and of course guards of the peace to assure a good time is had by all good citizens. 

 The Great Kahn Tigris even warms to Lord Dasher after Vlad Kallion shows up to become Captain Commander of the City. Tigris is seen to toast Lord Dasher, and make some poor but complimentary jokes about commanding cities in his sleep, but not as well and not as long as Lord Dasher. 

 The Dean of the Imperial School, Archmage Alex, is made the Judge of the Change. Alex is to be ombudsman of any and all disagreements that are not resolvable by Vlad Kallion and Lord Dasher (i.e. if Tigris and Kallion and Dasher can't come to an agreement, Alex gets to decide). 

 Vlad Kallion appears unsettled when he first meets Archmage Alex, but the Dean assures Vlad Kallion that they never met before. Apparently there once was a great warrior in the Bat Samurai named Alexander who bears a striking resemblence to Dean Alex. Vlad Kallion discretely lets the issue drop when Alex insists for the second time that Kallion must be mistaken, but the city guard investigation division soon after receives a relevant assignment that is Dasher/Kallion Eyes Only. 

 Vlad Kallion rapidly earns anew his reputation aquired over the last fifty years in Imperial Enseljos and Anarb. Brigand attacks on outlying farms are ruthlessly and agressively routed (he admits this is mostly due to the extra influx of Bat Samurai with no formal dutues). Kallion's repuation as a merciless Justice of the Peace comes to the common men and women. Port civillians rapidly decide that Kallion's Night Court is not a place for those with uncertain claims. 

 City Guards are more busy for perhaps a month. That is about how long it takes cutpurses to learn night is not any better than day when a Vlad makes the watch lists. Kallion is circumspect to assign only the standard 90% Khannish/10% other guard squads to make it known that it is his leadership, and not his School, which makes the city safer. 

 Lady Moeru opens a flower shoppe: The Rose Petal, with nightly hours and tea service, too. The genteel flock to it with relish in order to be seen there. Those with epicurian tastes in fauna resolve ouyt loud to return when the seedlings Moeru brought from her previous gardens bloom. Mages who need more rare vegetation can always find a clue, if not a bulb, in Moeru's establishment. Night life tends to gravitate about visits to The Rose Petal 'first part of the night,' 'the witching hour,' or 'the dawn service.' No one ever comments on the length of Moeru's teeth, or asks her to one's own parlor during the daylight. 

 The Free Port Suame is a more happy city than most have been in decades. The Emperor's wisdom is toasted many times in Kallion's first month.
