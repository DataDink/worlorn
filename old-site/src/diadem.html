Legend 	says there 	is only one diadem available for each clan, and one clan for each diadem. there are 	five clans 	known to have diadems: Brein; Keebler; Kestrel; Quaal; and Swan. the wisdom of the 	marks does not 	reveal any "lost" clans, unless one counts the Keebler clan. there is no precedent 	for new 	Larethian mark diadems; this is literally unheard of.</p>		<P><b>FORM</b></p>		<P>all five diadems are mithril, which is known only by a diadem wielder to be the petrified 		bones of outworld (children of?!?) Larethian. it follows that most Larethian clan leaders do not 		wear the diadem longer than official purposes require. the Swan diadem is known to be worn only 		when a Swan elfar has heard the Song of Avranaith. </p>		<P>although the diadems are not identical among all clans, each clan diadem form is known, 	and 	has been unchanged since the beginning times. diadems are circlets, or nearly complete 	circlets, 	perhaps eight inches across, no more than an inch high, with a narrow band on top and 	bottom 	separated by metalwork designs and settings for stones.</p>		<P>there are no spires or points like human kings display for counting their realms. each 	diadem 	is bejeweled with five 1" gem stone settings in front, one for each of the extant 	Larethian clans. 	Keebler is historically most often the far left jewel, even on his own diadem. 	the wielder's clan 	stone is otherwise centered in front, except for legendary iconoclast leaders, 	but there is no 	formal dispensation for position. Non-Swan clan leaders tend to put the most 	favored clan 	immediately right of center.  </p>		<P>a clan leader may change his or her clan's stone type by gifting each of the other clan 		leaders with a replacement delivered and installed personally by the clan leader. there have been 		gem changes performed by a member of the leader's personal hand, but the intermediary was always 		very highly respected by both clans down to the common folk. ritual gem changing visitations occur 		once or twice a decade without public pomp, giving frequent opportunities for most-favored status 		to change subtly. most Larethian clan leaders aren't as political as they are whimsical about 		pretty gems. traditionally, pearls, rubies, jade, agates, and glowstones are not used in diadems 		by Larethian clan leaders.</p>		<P><b>FUNCTION</b></p>		<P>a clan leader uses the clan diadem much as a mark, consulting the wisdom of each clan 	member 	present within the diadem. once shared with a diadem, the wisdom of clan contributors is 		preserved, even if they have their own separate mark.</p>		<P>diadem wielders of sufficient priestly level may cast gold rank miracles to copy or 	transfer 	wisdom from marks of their clan; non-priest(ess) clan leaders usually solicit the 	cooperation of 	priest(ess) to cast the widely known gold rank Larethian miracles, but this is not 	absolutely 	required, as explained below.</p>		<P>the Larethian gold rank miracle contains two restrictions to placing wisdom in a diadem: 	(1) a 	clan x diadem may store the wisdom contained within a mark only of its own clan x; (2) the 	wisdom 	of only the CURRENT mark wielder is shared (COPIED) into a diadem. the ritual is non-	trivial, and 	takes a week per level of the wisdom to be shared, plus a discretionary amount. 	this sharing 	ritual is similar to the gold rank ritual that preserves (STORES) wisdom in a clan 	mark when the 	wielder hears the Song of Avranaith. </p>		<P>A more complex gold rank miracle allows a clan mark to inherit (TRANSFER) the wisdom of 	one 	elder from the clan diadem (or, rarely, another mark), leaving the diadem bereft of the 	wisdom. 	inheritance is rare and is thought of by many (i.e. mostly just the swan) as a black 	deed by all 	involved.</p>		<P>All known attempts to make gold rank wizard spells to share or preserve or inherit wisdom 	of a 	mark have resulted in irrevocably lost wisdom. there are dark old legends of kav elfar 	stealing 	wisdom from Brein and Kestrel mark blades, but no such stories are told about current 	times. </p>		<P>it is known that a Larethian diadem allows its wielder to call upon the wisdom of any 	elder 	once per Crossing-in-the-Mist. in this manner, a Larethian diadem allows a non-priest(ess) 	wielder 	to share, inherit, and preserve the wisdom of a clan when all the clan priestly folk 	are 	unavailable. a theoretical newly-born diadem would need to have priestly wisdom shared 	with a gold 	rank miracle before the wielder could call upon such wisdom in this manner.</p>		<P>occasionally leaders have supplemented a diadem with enchantments for a particular 	purpose, 	but such enchantments apparently pass to Avranaith with the instigating clan leader.</p>		<P>most clan leaders give away their marks when they ascend to leadership role. Lorien was a 		notable exception, saying her mark was not worthy for any successor but for the "one who will be 	in sore need of my wisdom after i have passed." </p>		</font>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
