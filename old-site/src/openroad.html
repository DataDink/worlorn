with the immersion of  the dragon road in chaos, waldann discovered that the magic spell from  worlorn was terminated, and waldann once more could travel among  worlorn's dominions, and live.<p>however, while waldann had been seeking his fortune elsewhere, strange  and wonderous events had occurred in worlorn. the golden dragon road had  grown more talons, for now there were over thirty dominions of worlorn!  without exception, all the old worlds had been released by the dragon and  lost in the chaos sea, and four new worlds had replaced each of the old  dominions!<p>in the chaos of this new worlorn, waldann's memory was insufficient to  plot a safe course, and his road map was not wielded. waldann lost  control of his chariot, and in the accident waldann lost his  concentration, releasing the domain called the glove box into the sea of  chaos.<p>fortunately waldann's wonderous road map was able to cope with the  strangeness of worlorn, and properly displayed the routes between the  many new worlds of worlorn. the road map allowed waldann's magic bus to  drive a proper course between the talons of the dragon road.<p>although waldann's glove box was lost to the sea of chaos, waldann  regained his powers of concentration and was able to dominate another  world within a very short time. for his new dominion, waldann wanted to  regain his freedom from the world dragon's grasp, but did not wish to  establish dominion over a world which could fall into the sea of chaos.<p>to fulfill both of these goals, waldann studied the road map carefully,  and took control of the territory between the <a href="dominions.html">worlorn domains</a>. never  again would waldann lose his dominion to the sea of chaos, for he  dominated the very scales of the golden dragon's back which made up the  golden road!<p>in the new worlorn surrounded by chaos, waldann high-ironjade x dominates  all trade routes on the back of the golden dragon road between worlorn  dominions. 	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
