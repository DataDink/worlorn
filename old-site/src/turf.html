I found the <a href="muses.html">setof Muse statues</a> and studied them for a while. I then cleared away some unrulyfolks and staked out some Turf for people to have sweet dreams. Soon after,others staked out some Turf for their own Reign, but no one else on Worlorncould grant experience points for adventures without the statue of the Museof Dreams, Klinure. This is why Troad fell with the Statue of the Musestolen. <P><h3><a href="threnody.html">threnody</a> on turf</h3>Making turf [once] required having a place outside of Worlorn where-inone makes the natural laws and connecting that place to a like place onWorlorn, with a radius of significant land area on which all natural Laws maybe controlled (save for agreements at cpongruent boundaries, such as granting of experience points). All of the previously successful connections have been severed by the death of the turfholders.<P><a href="troy.html">Troy Ounces</a> is the only person who made turf on Worlorn without having aprevious connection. He had two advantages which may or may not have beensignificant. Troy got here first. Troy possessed the Muse of Dreams, andcould therefore determine how experience points were aquired.<P>From TroyOunces@aol.com Sun May 7 19:50:34 1995<P><h3>Threnody's Turf-acquisition research.</h3>He thinks <a href="erin.html">Erin</a>'s needed procedure is a bit more easy to define for thanNiteblade, since the Lord of Gnolls exists on Worlorn, and the goddess ShalOmnis doesn't exist or even have any worshippers except NightBlade. <P>However, Threnody thinks that Erin's potential Gnoll Kingdom Turf in Hell is,um, less valuable, [yeah "less valuable" that's it,] for the general populacethan Niteblade's Sanctuary of Peace Turf.<P>Examples will be directed to Erin since Threnody is more familiar with Erin'srequirements. Threnody can be far more explicit what Erin must do to vanquishthe Worlorn gnoll god than for Niteblade to invite the dragon goddess, ShalOmnis, to Worlorn.<P>In contemporary times, to claim Turf on Worlorn the candidate must have had aplace of unlimited control (somewhere offworld) and duplicate all theconditions on Worlorn. If there is not a corresponding location in existenceprevious to the candidate's arrival on Worlorn, then one must be formed.<P>Erin the Betrayer, in slaying the Gnoll king in another continuum, claimed aland of absolute control, the plane which had been the Gnoll King's. Toaquire Turf in the Worlorn system, Erin now must perform nearly identicalactions to set up the proper resonances and Claim Turf. Erin must go to Helland slay the Lord god of the Gnoll race and claim that plane of Hell forErin's Turf.<P>This Turf aquisition is complicated by many things. The first complication isthe difficulty of completing acquisition while in s-state dreaming[speech-only diceless adventures such as eD&D]. It would be much easier tokill the Gnoll King in d-state dreaming [dice adventures]. <P>S-state imposes a more direct confrontation such as Paper-Scissors-Stone, inwhich battle is resolved in a blink of an eye. D-state allows recovery ofmistakes but more casual exposure to deadly encounters. There is no runningaway in S-State if the opponent can kill you.<P>The second complication is the difficulty of doing the deed itself. The GnollGod is an archetype; he has not assumed such a role out of incompetence.While Erin has a great deal of power at his disposal, this may not be aheadlong brute-force-and-ignorance morganti-anyone-in-our-way type of deed.Some details on this follow.<P>In Worlorn, while the good planes (AKA "the Heavens") can be exited acountless number of ways, a creature may enter the Planes of Heavens only oneway: by personal invitation of a being in power there.<P>Likewise, to enter the evil planes (AKA the "Circles of Hell") one may useany number of magical transportations, but to leave, one must have thepersonal exit visa of the the Big Guy in the center of Hell. The bottom lineis that once entering Hell, a creature/soul/spirit is stuck in there, ineffective damnation, forever, or until the Big Guy says "you may leave."<P>Now don't go all sexist on me, says Threnody. You all know men are shits.Until recently this Master of Hell was a male Demonlord name of Tloluvin(Don't say that name out loud, kiddies!). With the demise of Tloluvin,another male, the Duke Asmodeus, won out over Orcus and claimed the centerstage. <P>Everyone, including Lords and Dukes in control of full portions of Hell, suchas the Lord of Gnolls, even the nine mean f*ckers in charge of one entireCircle of Hell, they all have to bow to Asmodeus and grant him whatever heasks if they want to leave Hell.<P>What this means is that even if Erin secures Turf in Hell, he's not going tobe a popular place for vacations. Anyone who comes to visit must passAsmodeus' approval before returning to another plane.<P>It seems obvious that the main power Troy assumed for Troad wasthe power of Dreaming for gaining Experience [points]. Therefore it seemsnon-coincidental that the Isle of Sleep and the Muse of Dreams were a majorfacet of the legend of Troad, and the source of its downfall. <P>Unless a creature wants to pursue Turf through an Outworld connection,Threnody belives a candidate for Turf needs to gain control the <a href="muses.html">Muse ofDreams or one of her seven or eight sisters</a>.<P>Although Klinure (Dreams) and Terpsichore (Dance and Choral music), are theonly ones known to have gotten out in the world for certain, there may bemore. Marlee got Terpsichore's statue Pinqued by the god Fuzzy Pinquehimself. Therefore we have in our time one less Muse of Worlorn to work withthan when Troy first arrived.<P>Once in control of the Muse, we need to secure "<a href="oimota.html">the Crown of Worlorn</a>" and"the Heart of the Earth" IN THAT ORDER. These are items which Troy donated tothe Masters at Roke during his days of study there. Troy claimed that theseitems could undo the precious balance of Turf if they were usedindiscriminately.<P>With the crown we can command the heart to grant us land area and bind ourmuse to it without [us] falling under the control of the heart. The heart is thedemon amulet of the Motherlode, who is generally of a lawful good dispositionand would not willingly give up any powers to a creature who has ever killedany creature intentionally. There is no f*cking way Erin of Dolkris willqualify under the Heart's rules.<P>This is a Tale told by Threnody. Listen, learn and ponder!<P><h2>Subj:  Threnody's Lists</h2>Date:  95-04-23 15:47:53 EDT<P><h3>Worlorn Turf: Fallen in approximately this order:</h3><ol><li><a href="troad.html">Troad</a> - fallen when Odysseus removed the statue from shadows to the desertof Lomarn. Shadows made unreachable with the smearing of Kin Blood on thePattern, see next item.<li><A HREF="northpole.html">North Pole</A> - Fallen/severed from the Wasteland with the death of XcalisRegence on Troy's Pattern. Remo did it; the illithids thought it such asmashing-good idea that they killed the Half-elven One and used his blood toruin the Pattern permanently to isolate persistent Troy's shadows fromWorlorn. Hal then Destroyed 34 and Remo killed 15 of the illithids. The 15skulls let Hal invent the illithid-skull-in-head thing, which proved dubiouswisdom when the illithid spirits became dominant. Ahem. Anyway...<LI><a href="kaldamaaren.html">Kaldamaaren</a> (the Hall of the Dwarfking) - fallen on the retirement (toabandoned dreams) of the TurfHolder Champion Eternal. Puk made him do it.<li><a href="paths.html">Paths of the Dead</a> - fallen when a wrathman executed these orders:<blockquote>"Annihilate the illithid who is wielding the Gold CARD TURF PATHS OF THEDEAD, who is known as the Deathgod, by gaining the sword necessary to slayit, going to the PATHS OF THE DEAD slaying the wielder of the PATHS OF THEDEAD, the DEATHGOD, thereby bringing about the destruction of the path ofdead and all beings SPONSORED FROM THERE." </blockquote>That charming command phrase is care of Erin of Dolkris, claims Threnody. And you don't know how hard that was to research!<li>District of Columbia <li> The <A HREF="goldroad.html">Gold Road</A> - fallen on the death of theturfholders, as the Paths of the Dead stopped sponsoring their non-continuouslife.<LI>Musquel by the Sea - fallen on the Destruction of Ko, recently, at thehands of Maeglin.<LI><A HREF="elidor.html">Elidor</A>? <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>/Novus Mundi? Ogygia? It's anyone's guess, butThrenody thinks there are supposed to be eight Turfs and right now therearen't any left under the Compact of Worlorn.</ol>Threnody thinks it's too bad Salt Peter died at the fall of the Paths,because Mr. Peter was the best-informed about this turf stuff, seeing as itwas his sage-specialty. Too bad his library burned the night he died.<P>see also <a href="turf_tutorial.html">turfholder 101</a>.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
