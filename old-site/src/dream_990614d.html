She whispered the word, "<a href="flambeau.html">Flambeau</a>."		For a moment it appeared that she moved the fire into his face, but then the		brightness was gone, and Derrick was unburnt.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		However, the room had changed. Instead of a the tree house under the stars, the		two stood indoors within a torch lit room. The walls were spherical, unpolished		metallic grey, but brightly lit by torches like the one Sharra was placing into		a freestanding black wrought iron sconce. The floor, too, was circular now		instead of a square, a wooden platform only fifteen feet across, giving the		effect of an airy moat between the wood and the  spherical walls. A walkway		extended from a single door to the platform where the pair stood alone. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra whispered, " &#146;Ware the walls of cold iron." and pointed to the doorway.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The single door was guarded by two drow warriors, helmless, but otherwise in		traditional drow blacks: midnight cloaks, Galvorn mail, greaves, and boots.		They came to attention immediately, drawing longswords and peering at Sharra		and Derrick. Immediately, one nodded to Sharra, and both lowered their weapons.		However, neither guard sheathed their blade, preferring instead to point them		to the floor behind their heels, partially hidden in their cloaks.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra strode down the walkway to the guards without acknowledging them. Derrick		caught up with her as they passed the guards. The door was wide enough for the		two to walk abreast between the drow, and they did. Derrick noticed the iron		door had a wheel in place of a knocker, on both sides. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		As he crossed the threshold, Derrick was inundated with thick smells of sulfur		and incense. However, no smoke was visible. The corridor outside extended straight,		as far as Derrick&#146;s eye could see.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The corridor was wider than the door, perhaps the diameter of the iron sphere,		thirty feet wide. The walls were grey stone, and the smooth floor was black,		perhaps blocks of polished obsidian polished like glass. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Also as far as the eye could see, the torch lit corridor was occupied by guards,		adult drow men and women. They had tables and cots, clothes racks, wardrobes,		and dressers, center aisle as open as the walls were cluttered, as if an army		was bunkered here with all its gear.  		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The corridors were eerily silent. None of the drow spoke out loud, of course,		and the sounds of their movements were muffled. Other than the soft sounds of		chanting in the distance, there was sound from the occupants of the endless hall. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Twenty steps past the guards, Sharra glanced sideways at Derrick and stopped. She		placed her hand behind his neck and pulled his head close. She leaned so her forehead		touched Derrick&#146;s, and whispered, "While I live, my consort would not be threatened.		A companion might be challenged." She suddenly strode away. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		After a moment, Derrick contented himself to follow a step behind when he caught		up. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Thirty steps past the guards, and every thirty steps beyond, the corridor was		reinforced by dark wooden beams, a square foot in cross section, held aloft by		pillars of similar wood. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Two torches in floor sconces stood beneath each beam. As they approached, Derrick		noticed that the beams and pillars were carved with designs: warriors in battle,		people slaying dragons, sailors on ships at sea. The wood was carved from left to		right, starting at the base of the left pillar; all were at various stages of		completion.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"The stories of eight thousand warriors carved in Weir Wood," Sharra breathed quietly		over her shoulder. "Conscious here between mortal incarnations. Forty one miles of		barracks between foyer and throne room." Derrick met her eyes, and Sharra smiled.		"We won&#146;t walk the whole way." she assured.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Words aside, Derrick followed Sharra, striding past dozens of beams. Walking past		beam after beam, Derrick saw that the drow occupants had arranged the corridor		into private areas with the beams as boundaries. Their gear looked well cared for,		much of it opulent, although some well-worn items appeared to have cherished places.		Most areas appeared unoccupied, but well kept.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		No one read, or sat still, or meditated in silence. Every drow present, man or woman,		was working at something: none appeared bored. Some practised weapons alone or with		a neighbor. Some had tables set for alchemistic experiments, some had altars for		singsong, prayer or chanting rituals. The religious icon appeared to be a bird,		rising from a large fire.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Some drow worked the stone, carving doorways into the stone walls between beams.		Perhaps one room in five had no gear in the hall, but instead revealed only a doorway		in one or both walls. All completed doorways had cloth or beadwork hanging over them,		some with multiple layers. "Death Shrouds," breathed Sharra, catching the direction		of Derrick&#146;s glance. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Some drow carved at their beams overhead. "Lest they forget their previous lives,"		whispered Sharra. "They would be ashamed not to know their stories when judged by		their goddess." 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		After walking perhaps an hour, Sharra stopped and lifted a torch from a floor sconce.		Nearby drow looked over with curiosity, but no malice, and none stopped her work.		Sharra grasped Derrick&#146;s right hand and again seemed to shove the torch in his		face momentarily, despite a warding gesture. This time Derrick heard no word		from Sharra. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Looking about, Derrick saw the hallway was exactly the same, but differently		populated. Sharra kept the torch in hand, but released Derrick&#146;s fingers. Sharra		walked to a vacant section of hallway, stood before a doorway covered by many		layers of silver lace. She closed her eyes, held the torch out to Derrick. When		he took it from her, she said "stay," and ducked behind the curtain.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Derrick looked about. The neighborhood was filled with only women, all kneeling,		all chanting in front of simple altars constructed of expensive materials. The		pillars to one side and the beams overhead were entirely covered with carvings,		and Derrick saw all the unfinished pillars had designs from the ceiling to within		a foot of the floor. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Derrick looked to the pillars on the left and right of Sharra&#146;s door. He stepped		to the right. The most recent carving was only an inch from the floor. Derrick&#146;s		finger traced the figure of a woman with hair the length Sharra&#146;s had been, carrying		a body from what appeared to be a bald-headed man with tentacles for a beard: a mind		flayer.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		He stood abruptly when Sharra appeared. She bore a staff of wood, the same hue as		the beams and pillars, capped with the black Galvorn metal on each end, inset with		fire opals and carved with designs in the same style as the pillar Derrick stood		nearest. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra&#146;s eyes travelled from Derrick&#146;s face to the base of the near pillar, and		back. She turned away, whispering, "keep it lit." She strode, faster than before,		up the hallway. Derrick had to run a few steps to catch her.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		As they passed beneath the beams, Derrick noticed the number of praying women		dwindling. At the same time, above and to both sides the wood become entirely		covered with designs. Presently there was no empty space at the base of the		pillars. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Soon after, Derrick saw some two-foot tall three-limbed carpenters with huge eyes		replacing the carved beams with fresh wood, displaying no carvings at all. The delicate		creatures chattered quietly amongst themselves, but not loud enough for Derrick to		recognize any words.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Serioli," said Sharra, startling Derrick with the volume of her normal speaking		voice. "Moties. E.T. phone home. They are the best artificers in all the worlds.		Serioli race has been slaves their entire existence." Over her shoulder, Derrick		saw Sharra smile faintly. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Apparently the Serioli were stone masons as well as carpenters, for a minute later		Derrick passed some of the creatures tearing down curtains. They were sealing off		rooms with mortar and cut blocks of the wall&#146;s material.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Within ten minutes of leaving Sharra&#146;s room, Derrick and she had walked to the		end of the hall. Here the portal contained doors of wood bound in iron, with		iron knockers instead of wheels. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Here the portal was guarded by a score of male drow warriors with spears and short		swords at the ready, none of whom appeared to recognize Sharra. There were three		priestesses on each side of the door, each with her Galvorn armor bearing the		symbol of a red bird rising from flames. Those on the left also decorated their		armaments with rubies, and those on the right were decorated with fire opals.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		One male soldier from each side of the door stepped forward and made the hand		sign for "Halt." Sharra stopped and clapped her staff against the obsidian floor,		unexpectedly making quite a few cringe from the sound. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra regarded not the soldiers before her, but the women near the doors. She		lifted her empty hand, and froze monetarily. Simultaneously, a priestess on each		side spoke sharply in an unholy tongue most lawful and evil, and a complete and		deafening silence descended on the corridor. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra signaled with the hand over her head. "I have the right to audience with		the Queen given to me personally by the Greater Prince of Evil Drow Devils himself."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"The Prince is no more," signed the priestess on the left, confidently. "His will		is moot."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Her peer across the hall waited until the first had finished before signing, "You		may pass, Sharra, the Decameron." 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Another priestess on the right side signed, "Your Wathan is known to us regardless		of your face this life, beloved sister."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The third priestess on the right side signed, almost before the second had finished,		"Be welcome, Mistress of Fire." 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Nodding to each other across the hall, all six priestesses take off their black		gloves. Derrick barely has a chance to notice their scarred hands before the six		women grasp the iron door knockers. However, Derrick can plainly see the women		scowl and grimace as they pull the heavy doors open. He notes that all six fall		to their knees after the doors swing wide, and how the soldiers come to their		aid, spreading healing salves over inflamed palms.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra had paused to allow Derrick to enter immediately behind her. Entering the		room, Derrick became aware that his Githzerai companion followed visibly behind		him.  Derrick noted his Gith appeared to be equipped as only a mirror of Derrick		once more: nothing extra, nothing missing.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The room within was huge, a cave without end, a massive open hall. From his vantage		at the entrance, about thirty feet above floor at the top of an obsidian stair,		Derrick could barely see the distant throne at the room&#146;s center, and the far		walls were lost in the smoky haze.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The din was almost as thick as the smoke. There was much singing and laughter.		There were drow people, eldren and drider, gathered about countless fire pits		of coal. Various things were being cooked above the pits, and the cavernous		expanse overhead filled with all the smoke that wasn&#146;t in the hallway. The room		held none of the order or serenity of the hallway. It was as if all the restraint		of the hall was shorn from the drow who entered the throne room.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra put her hands on the rail of the stair and stood, surveying the room. She		called over her shoulder, "In this place at this time, this room, I won&#146;t be able		to represent your friend. I presume there&#146;s a chance he can fend for himself."		Derrick looked at the gith, who shrugged, but drew a poisoned blade from its		sheath.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra of the Flames stepped down the stairwell without a glance backwards to her		companions. Derrick followed, with his gith a step behind. Derrick counted seventeen		steps before placing his foot on the black glass of the floor. With the last step,		Derrick descended into an army of drow warriors and priestesses as far as his eye		could see.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Even before descending, Sharra had engaged the attention of the nearby crowds.		Three warrior women at the nearest firepit approached Sharra warily, and stood		ten feet from the stairwell bottom. The three wore fire opals on the hilts of		their drawn swords. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance existed that Derrick saw Sharra hand-sign to them "I remember you," as		he heard Sharra say "I am Decameron." One woman smiled, one woman spit at Sharra&#146;s		feet, and one turned away without a comment. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The smiling woman signed, "We hope you have a life left to return to your people."		A chance existed that Derrick saw Sharra sign a negation. "A last timer," said the		woman out loud, with wonder. The spitting woman laughed, and held her hand high to		sign, "I patiently wait for our illness to pass."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra strode past her and the other. Derrick followed un accosted, but the gith		was bodily grasped in both hands by the spitting woman. She began to speak out,		in the unholy language of law and evil.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		However, a chance existed that Sharra noticed the altercation. A chance existed		that she spat a tiny flame directly at the woman&#146;s face. A chance existed that		the drow woman would not be resistant to Sharra&#146;s fire. A chance existed that		the woman would be blinded, and a chance existed that she would run directly		into the nearby fire pit in her agony. A chance existed that the burning woman&#146;s		companions calmly returned to their discussions by the firepit.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra glared at the gith. "I fight my own battles," she said. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The gith looked up and replied clearly, in Khannish, "No, you were fighting mine." 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance existed that there would be no other significant events as Sharra and		Derrick made their way to be recognized by the drow woman on the throne.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The dais under the throne was three concentric slabs of the same grey stone		comprising the corridor. Each of the three layers was a foot high, a stack		made of thirty, forty, and fifty foot squares. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The throne was an immense iron chair, suitable for a small giant, inlaid with		all colors and sizes of precious stones. Some previous tenant had made pale		leather seat cushions that were designed to assist an elven-sized person to		sit without sliding about, supporting her back without picking her feet off		the dais, and armrests made so an elf&#146;s delicate skin might not have to touch		the cold iron arms of the throne. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra approached the dais. About sixty feet away, she sought out and presented		herself to a priest with the burning bird on his armor. Without exchanging words		or sign, the drow poked her finger with his quill, and wrote Sharra&#146;s name		on a scroll: Decameron: Sharra of the Flames. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Almost immediately, the Priest turned away from Sharra and pointed to a drow		female warrior, crossing the stranger&#146;s name off the list with a line of		Sharra&#146;s blood. A chance existed that Derrick calculated the spacing at		twenty names per foot of the scroll, which put Sharra sixty to seventy names		down from the last crossed off name. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		For the rest of the visit, Derrick did not notice anyone else approach the priest		to add his or her name to the list, yet for his entire visit, there was an unending		stream of supplicants to the throne. As Derrick and Sharra waited for an audience,		the dais remained empty save for the throne and its occupant. The supplicant was		allowed to approach only to the second tier. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance did not exist for Derrick to get a clear view of the Queen until Sharra		approached the throne. Until that time, Sharra took Derrick aside to an otherwise		abandoned fire pit and coached Derrick about the protocols for the court of the		Greater Prince of Evil Drow Devils. Sharra appeared uncertain about only when she		mentioned that the Queen on the throne was a reincarnation, not the Greater Prince.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Approaching behind Sharra, Derrick mimicked her every gesture, kneeling when she		did, rising, all the while apparently keeping his eyes on the stone dais as she		did. When Sharra knelt the final time, Derrick approached until he stood behind		her left foot, and gazed down towards the floor.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance existed for Derrick to hold a piece of metal as mirror to view the Queen		surreptitiously. Although it appeared that the Queen was looking right at Derrick,		he studied her without turning away. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Queen Threnody was a youth, perhaps in her first fifty years, certainly having		seen less than a century. Her short-cropped hair was barely on the yellow side		of strawberry blonde. Although seated, the queen was probably 5&#146; 6&#148; tall		and 116 pounds, just like every other drow he had seen since coming to the court.		Leaning away, lazing against the back of her throne, legs played out in front,		the Drow Queen reminded Derrick of a phrase: "long slim legs, reaching all the		way down to the floor..."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Queen Threnody wore only black, and alone of all drow in the room, wore no armor.		Her billowing cloak was hemmed using black leather with silver studs, and trailed		unpractically from the foot of her throne to end on the obsidian floor, some fifty		feet away. Beneath her unclasped cloak she wore a lace camisole, a web of		spaghetti straps from collarbone to midriff. A huge diamond covered each nipple,		and the minimal strings otherwise revealed more of her pale breasts than they		concealed. The Queen&#146;s low hipped leggings had a slit up each leg, inside		and out, flowing up from ankle until they disappeared under a mini skirt that		was almost a belt. The Queen&#146;s relaxed posture revealed to Derrick a codpiece		of sequins or diamonds glittering in the firelight. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Her other jewelry was entirely silver and platinum, save for a moonstone set in		gold piercing, her right ear lobe. The queen wore a ring on each of her delicate		toes, otherwise her ivory feet were bare. A fine linked chain graced her left		ankle. She wore what looked like platinum manacles on each wrist. She had a ring		on each finger and each pale toe. Other than metal and black, the only color she		wore was hanging off a silver neck chain: a pale green triangle dangling between		her breasts. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The pendant matched her jade eyes. They appeared to watch Derrick as he assessed		her. Derrick kept his moving.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Queen had weapons at hand. Unlike the spears, shortswords, and longswords		favored by her people, the queen&#146;s weapons were a well-used wakizashi and		katana set, sheathed in black lacquered scabbards, and resting in a lacquered		stand on her left arm rest. She leaned a 6 foot two-handed tachi against her		left shoulder, held loosely in her left hand like a staff. Unlike those of the		smaller two swords, this scabbard was covered in the same pale leather of the		throne armrests and seat cushions. Derrick could read blue lettering on the		scabbard, legible despite reversal in his mirror: MOM. There was a heart drawn		around the word in the same blue ink.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Meeting his eye once again, the Queen cleared her throat and began speaking in		Khannish. Derrick&#146;s eyes flitted to the grey stone of the dais, losing the		Queen&#146;s reflection in his metal mirror. No chance existed for Derrick to		regain his composure and view the Queen during this audience.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We recognize our Decameron."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Thank you my Queen." When Sharra replies in Khannish a great many miracles were		cast in the unholy tongue of law and evil, and a bit of quiet murmuring arose		among those who cast no miracles.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"State your Wishes."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Queen, I have need of a Master Control Device in the possession of the Hellen."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We have known of Hermione&#146;s Collection. Your Wish to avenge yourself against		the Illithids is nearly as widely known."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Queen, I Wish not to possess the wand for Illithids and mind flayers. I Wish		for another device. I have become aware that a crown exists for the ogre races.		I wish to take it from this place and put it in the possession of a . . . some		companions."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Decameron, you are ever bold. Why fore shall we grant thee thy Wishes when		thou chooseth to remain heretic and outside the fold for your last story?"		Much muttering arose amongst those priestesses who were following the		Queen&#146;s words. She continued without pause.  "If we were to recognize		you in your current incarnation, might not our people think of us that our		fires do not burn as brightly? If we are incarnated differently, it is because		we choose it so. We think you also have made a choice. Would you prefer to		wear your current flesh?"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Derrick heard Sharra&#146;s intake of breath. The pause grew, longer, almost		too long for the Queen to ignore.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Queen," said Sharra. "You know I serve you in all ways. Have you not told		me how this body pleased you--"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Enough!" the Queen interrupted. From the throne there was the sound of clothing		being arranged, and jewelry clicking on stone. "We shall discuss only the pleasure		of my current incarnation."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"What pleases you most, my Queen?"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"It pleases us to have you attend my court while we entertain your question."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Thank you my queen." said Sharra. "I could Wish for nothing less." She rose to		her feet and retreated backwards from the throne. She moved so slowly that Derrick		was easily able to maintain his distance.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra continued to retreat until the next supplicant, a drow male, moved forward.		When he began to sign to the Queen, Sharra turned away from the dais, and Derrick		noticed her lips, tightly pressed together.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The two humans returned to the firepit. A chance existed that friendly members		of the fire opal clan had left food and drink sufficient for Derrick, and Sharra		to be nourished for the seventy four hours until Sharra was summoned before the		throne again. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		During the hours they waited, no chance existed for others to speak with them,		and no chance existed for either Derrick or Sharra to seek the company of others.		At the seventy-fourth hour, the priest came for Sharra, and led her to the dais.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We recognize Decameron."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Thank you my Queen." 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We are lead to believe your motivations for possessing the Master Control device		may not coincide with the interests of my Dark Children."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"I have never acted against the Dark Children, my Queen."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"The Decameron might act outside the direct interests of our people without		acting &#146;against&#146; our people."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"What pleases you most, my Queen?"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We are most pleased when our people act like our people. Decameron, you do no		longer act like a Dark Childe." The queen paused. "What say you, Decameron? Are		you yet a Dark Childe?"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Queen . . . I can say . . . I have nothing to say."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We think you have grown soft on the surface." There was a sound of clothing		being adjusted on the throne. "We think that you discard all your lifetimes of		Childean wisdom. You have grown human in one short lifetime."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Qu--" Sharra broke off her words as a golden crown rolled before her, and		fell flat within arms reach. It was a simple gold cylinder, with no jeweled		ornamentation. Derrick could count seventeen peaks about its circumference.		Sharra reached out and grasped the crown. A black bag dropped to the floor		near where the crown had been. Sharra picked up the bag and immediately set		the crown inside. She pulled the drawstrings tight and tied the bag shut.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We think your tenth tale has a sad ending, Decameron. We do not wish to hear		tell of it."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"My Queen. You . . . you shall hear of me no more."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"We dismiss this Decameron, this Sharra of the Flames, and grant leave for her		two companions to depart with her."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sharra backed away from the throne much as she had before. Sharra said nothing		to Derrick on her path from the throne, nothing as they departed the chamber,		and still nothing as they walked down the wide deserted corridor. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		At her room. again she commanded him to "Stay," but comparing word against word,		Derrick this time heard less of command and more of habit. Sharra&#146;s second		visit was longer than her first, but on leaving, displayed nothing extra, no		longer carried her staff. Aside from the bag with the crown in it, Sharra appeared		to have nothing she didn&#146;t have as she came to this place.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Upon exiting the room, Sharra knelt at the unfinished inch of wood and drew a		bone handled knife from her belt. She knelt and lifted the knife above her		head as if to stab the pillar, but then lowered the blade to hold it in both		hands. The tableau held a moment before she returned the knife to her sheath. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance existed for Derrick to hear what she said then: "I am NOT finished."		She wiped her eyes with her fingertips, rose and glared at Derrick. "Enough!"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A chance existed for Derrick to ask a question. "How many?" he said, sweeping		his arm from pillar to pillar, encompassing the beam overhead. "How long?"		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"All of them. Over four thousand years." Sharra now saw, not the inch, but		the rest. "My Wathan is nearly Ancient, just six years short of a full cycle.		Four thousand, four hundred and thirty eight years. This is my last . . . I		was a candidate." Derrick watched her face turn from despair to anger. "I AM		a candidate."		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		He smelled wood smoke a bare instant before he saw the pillar blacken and		char as from a disease within. Before a full second had passed, the wood		was engulfed in flame, both pillars plus the beam overhead. The intense heat		was so sudden that Derrick heard the wood crack, left, right, and overhead.		The beam collapsed. Instantly there was no air to breathe that wasn&#146;t		superheated by fire. Derrick lifted his hand to shield his face from the		flames, and felt Sharra grasp his shoulder and give him a push.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A moment later cool air washed over his skin, into his lungs. Derrick stood		with Sharra at Noni&#146;s tree in Berrilyn, with the whole group staring		on, as if their trip through the flames had happened in an instant.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
