Braith, Ironjade, Shanagate, Taal, andGlowstone: all wear iron-and-fire with green glowstones. Mestea turns to Shan, who is staring at the kavs with a look of defeat,but strangely without surprise.At 06:49 AM 9/22/99 -0700, Mestea wrote:>"I suppose if the Crossing-in-the-Mist goes to where by definition> nothing ever happens, then by definition something _has_ to> happen where the Crossing-in-the-Mist is not.>"Shan,  I do want to share with you, sometime, what happened > to Jil, because you have asked.  >"But for me, I would like to show you the writing in my spell book > that I do not recall penning.

His face is bloodless, stunned. Shan closes his eyes andreaches out. >She has left tears on the back of his hand.Etienne high-Shanagate Villiers guides his teyn's arm to the bar, andturns Shan so he can lift the elf onto a barstool. Shan is as a doll,sitting where his teyn positions him, and holding still otherwise.His eyes remain closed, the flesh of his face white. Villiers crouchesby the stool, busying himself by arranging Shan's gear and tidying histeyn's perfect attire, talking all the while, "It is not so unexpected, my friend? After seeking _her_ for so long, to finally find her searching for us? It was hinted before this day that she might wear an enemy's face, and we have spoken of this moment. You are not so unfamiliar with the gift of irony. "Perhaps it is time to speak her name out loud again. You must be strong or our green kethi shall use this as excuse to challenge your weakness.  If you don't let us speak freely,  people will think you afraid of <a href="darkagnes.html">Dark Agnes</a>. Tonight I have  no desire to duel--"A sob escapes Shan Shanagate, and he covers his face with his hands,turning to place both elbows on the bar. Villiers stands abruptly,scarily fast, and twirls his fur-trimmed cloak from his own shouldersto Shan's with one graceful pirouette, as if dancing momentarily withthe wrap."Friends and acquaintances, please leave us to our personal troubles.  Shan and I have helped you this day write your histories well. Please give us privacy to write this page of our own. Once it is written, we shall surely read the tale to you later, in words that do not trouble us when we hear them. "We shall join you at your convenience when you summon us to the estate of Salt Peter's daughter. The talk of the town informs me that the Dean has retained the son of Huery  Que-Que as her personal chef. On any evening when  the menu includes more than steak Tartare, we would  enjoy partaking of the renown Wallachian culinary genius."Villiers moves his arms wide and turns his palms outward. He begins toshoo the party from the Happy Toad. Shan Shanagate remains hunched lowat the bar. Beneath the thick cloak, his shoulders tremble and heave.		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
