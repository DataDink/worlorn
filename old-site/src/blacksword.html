Blacksword wears an Amulet of Great Beauty and great weight, "The Star of Beauty" from which all charisma and beauty comes for [Worlorn]. In addition to controlling Life Ressurrection, and and Rebirth, The Phoenix Blacksword suddenly finds himself responsible for beauty throughout [Worlorn].Unfortunately, Blacksword's twin skippy (Threnody) is oddly unavailable for conversations, so you need to find others for advice. Threnody was put into a magical sleep during his last crossing-in-the-mist, and has not been awakened.Two <i>er-per&#146;henne</i> are available for conversation in Blacksword's turf "The Fountains of Paradise." <ul><li>Gules Lyon (Blacksword's son!?!) is a leader of the Phoenix Fighter School, and <li>Perris high-Larteyn, is the Pope of the religion worshipping rebirth and Life via the Phoenix. </ul>Perris suggests The Phoneix Blacksword work with <a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a>, who he says may be trusted to ensure The Compact grants the followers of Phoenix fighter schools and Phoneix religions magical abilities based on the power of the Phoenix's Star of Beauty. For example, Perris says The Phoneix Blacksword may write a rule in the Compact (ask Eressea for help with the wording) which guarantees every two-sword Phoenix fighter a ring of human influence (charisma-based persuasion), and every Cannon of the Phoneix (6th level Cleric) a rod of beguiling. These are examples supplied by Perris. Gules Lyon suggests that Phoenician figthers be granted the power to enthrall enemies with beautiful swordplay, so that no enemy will foolishly cause unnecessary battle. Gules suggsts Phoenician priests be granted the ability topenetrate elven charm immunity., and be 100% immune to other charms instead of 90% immune.Both Gules Lyon and Perris agree that you should writea rule which guarantees ressurrection or rebirthto Phoenician fighters and clerics who are broughtto Phoenician temples. They agree to this as ifit were an obvious truth.Using the theme of Beauty, Blacksword can certainly come up with his own ideas to grant powers of life and beautyto followers of The Phoenix Blacksword. This beauty is what attracted Hannibal Lecter to Ozzy Fudd. Good thing Hannibal was mistaken which of Sentient Pat's dreamswas Llewellyn's Nightmare....With The Phoenix Blacksword's permisison, Perris will show The Phoenix Blacksword how to make a magic mirror from the Star of Beauty, in order that The Phoenix Blacksword may watch over his people, the entire Phoenician elven race. Historically, this 'mirror' has been the surface of a river which flows the length of the Fountains of Paradise,Pat may change the form to suit Blacksword's whim, Perrisseems to think it's imperative for a turf holder to make a mirror as his first offical act.</pre></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
