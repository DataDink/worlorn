They werevery young in their years, and their passion was legend amongst theirpeoples. They shared many decades in the pleasure of each others&#146; company,years of pleasure and sharing, that ended on the woman&#146;s 361st birthday.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Shan "the Swordsman" wanted to gift his lady love with the Agate Rose, aflower said to bloom only once each Cycle. This living stone thrived only on<a href="elidor.html">El Lydor</a>, the fabled Isle inhabited by four Dragon Lords. Shan quested forthe flower, and is said to have found it. However, returning to Lartroxia,Shan found himself displaced in time, forward thousands of years into theCycle of <a href="dreams.html">Dreams</a>.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">He searched for his lady love for countless years without success. No living LiosElfar existed with the name of Shan&#146;s lady love.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Believing she had heard the Song of Avranaith, Shan and a fellow Historian,Etienne Villiers became leaders of the remnants of their High Elfar people.They served under the Kav Elfar traveller god, named Waldann high-Ironjade X.Shan named his holdfast Shanagate after his lost love.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">After living for nearly a century in the Cycle of Dreams, Shanhigh-Shanagate met his lady again under a different name, the name <a href="darkagnes.html">DarkAgnes</a>. She had lived through the end of the Cycle of <a href="history.html">History</a> andwas trying for the magical immortality granted by a lifespan of 4444 years.After living through four millennium with only the memory of Shan, she wasfond of him, but understandably no longer passionately in love. ShanShanagate had seen than a decade without his love, and was determined to winher back.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Shan tried everything short of imprisonment and charm spells, but wasultimately unsuccessful. He stopped harassing Dark Agnes eventually and madehis own life away from her. Shan learned she died from a <a href="morganti.html">Morganti</a> Weaponnearly a year after it happened. Divinations revealed that <a href="dhruva.html">Dhruva</a> slew DarkAgnes to appease the Demonlord of Red Light for some favor.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">In an attempt to comfort him, Etienne Villiers had told Shan of an "ancientprophesy" that a "Holdfast founder" would be reunited with his "timelesslove" after she "wore a different face." With this knowledge, Shan grewdistracted in his duties as Holdfast leader, spending Shanagate Holdfast&#146;swealth and magic searching for Dark Agnes wearing a different face. Theresources of the wealthiest holdfast were depleted in his desperation.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Within the decade, the <a href="necrodemus.html">Necrodemian</a> Kingdom Garfield Land bordering onShanagate Holdfast attacked and decimated it by fielding a hundred unboundRed Dragons and a thousand Pellinese Orcs. The halls of Shanagate Holdfastnow hold only ash and bone, its remaining kethi wandering the lands ofLartroixa with no hearth or true home. Since then, Shan Shanagate has beenshallowly respected by the remaining Kav Elfar holdfasts, who see only thatShanagate Holdfast was overthrown by a woman, Jil Sander.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Two years ago an accomplished minstrel of Canaith training informed Shanthat he had met a young Lios Elfar woman that spoke with the voice of DarkAgnes. Since then Shan high-Shanagate and his teyn Etienne high-ShanagateVilliers have been searching for this elusive Lios woman.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Historical evidence suggests that two years ago <a href="mestea_elf.html">Mestea</a> was possessed by a Lios Elfar Enchantress during an encounter with a Canaith minstrel from theKestrel Mark. Mestea now shares the features of Jil Sander. 	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
