"Taimarra! It's not timefor bed. You need to stay awake for now."<p>You open your eyes. Nothing much has changed. It's still cold. Your leftmitten is still in mother's hand, and her hands are both a pretty blueyou've never seen before. Her right hand isn't strong enough to grap yoursany more, so Mother pulls you along with both hands now, through the snow,up the mountain. Father is up ahead, leading, and carrying Baby Sam in hisarms. His steps are shorter than before. Mother and you are keeping up withhim with hardly any extra effort. baby Sam is probably not so cold. Samgets the blanket, because she's the Baby now, and you are not.<p>There's snow everywhere you look. It's on the trees, on the ground, eventhe sky is the color of snow. Last year's winter was the first one youremember, but you don't think it was this white. At least it's daytime.Last night it was  even harder to stay awake. You never walked all nightbefore. No one you know ever walked all night. <p>You close your eyes for a moment after mother looks away, but instantlyshe's shaking your arm again, harder than before, and she has the scarytone in her voice. You aren't walking, and you think you may have beenstanding still for a while, maybe without walking for a while. It's RedLight, and you know what that means. Soon it will be night time and youwill have even more trouble staying awake. <p>"Tam! Look honey, it's really important that you don't sleep now. Can youhear me dear? Honey, Tam, look, dear it's time for you to carry Samanthanow. Father is too tired. He has to rest for a while." <p>Father is lying down on his stomach. Father usually sleeps on his back, andsnores. Father is not snoring now. Sam is still in her blanket, the onlyone left, the only one Father could find. Sam's the Baby, so she gets theBlanket. Sam is in Mother;s lap now. You never get to sit there any more,not since Sam got to be the Baby.<p>"Tam, Honey, I'm going to stay with Father now." Mother's lips are black inRed Light, the same color as her fingers. You didn't see her take anymake-up from the house. "Do you see that fire up the mountain?" Motherpoints with her whole arm. Her fingers are all curled together on the end,the way they are when she holds your hand. You look up, and since it's notsnowing very hard, you can see the fire. The flames are almost the samecolor as Red Light, which makes them harder to see.<p>"I see them Mother." <p>Mother puts her hands on each side of your face, and turns your head toface her. They are cold as the snow, not warm like Mother's hands aresupposed to be. they are also stiff, and crusted with ice like your clothesare.<p>"I want you to take Sam to the fire. This is very important dear. You needto take Sam to the fire, before you can sleep. When you get to the fire, ifit's in a cabin or house or cave, you need to wait until after Red Lightbefore you knock on the door. No one will let you in if you knock on thedoor during Red Light--"<p>"I know _that_ Mother! I'm not the Baby any more." She looks at you andthen smiles, but she's crying.<p>"Tam, you need to take Sam to the fire and let the people there know whereFather and I are sleeping. You can go to sleep after you take Sam to thefire and tell them Mother and Father are sleeping here. Do you understand?"<p>"Yes, Mother."<p>Mother tries to pick up Sam, but her fingers aren't working right, so youhave to puck her up in your mittens. Mother manages to unwrap the blanket abit and put it over your head, like a shawl. "Tell them where we are." Shesays, and pushes you up the mountain.<p>You begin to walk alone, and turn around after two steps. Mother is lyingdown next to Father, arranging her cloak. You look hard at the fire andbegin to walk. It's a long walk, but you think you can get there before youhave to sleep.<p>After ten steps, you wake up, and later you wake up later. Sam is asleep,but she's the Baby, and you have an Order from Mother. No sleeping untilyou reach the fire. It's still Red Light, and you can see the flames closerbut still up the mountain. They look like they're coming from a squarewindow in a house, but you can't tell for certain. When you turn around youcan see your tracks, but Mother and Father are hidden behind the trees.You walk some more, but wake up with your face in a snowdrift, on theground with Sam crying. You must have fallen asleep and then fallen on her!You hold Samantha tightly, cooing at her, and she calms, crying but nothysterical. You look at the fire, and wish they would hear Samantha'scries. You lay there for a few more minutes, and Sam stops crying. You laydown only for another second. You close your eyes, because you know you'llopen them again in a second.<p>They are beating you awake. All five ogres are clubbing you, bringing theirmaces down on your head, legs, and chest. You draw your Slaver Weapon, liftyour arm, and one hits your wrist, shattering bone and flinging the Weaponacross the camp.<p>"No more Dreams! No more Dreams!" they chant in unison. It becomes the ogremantra, like an oarsman's song to beat time. They hit you each time theychant. "No more Dreams" *thud* "No more Dreams" *smack* <p>You begin to crawl away, and they let you, cointinuing to pummel you as youmove. You find your bow, and use it in your good hand as a crutch. When youget to your feet, you run, leaving everything behind.<p>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">taimarra&#146;s <a href="taimarra_1.html">second dream</a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
