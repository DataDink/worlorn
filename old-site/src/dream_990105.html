She sits at a	nine-sided table. There are eight others sitting at the table, four men	and four women. Each has a companion seated behind and to the right.	Some companions are taking notes on paper. Others are wide eyed, like	tourists. None of them are important <i>er per&#146; henne</i> in this place at	this time, except for the man behind the Wallachian Prince: Vlad Callion.</p><P>Directly across from your mentor&#146;s chair sits <a href="petros.html">Vlad Petros</a>,	the Prince of Wallachia. His aid Vlad Callion is the Captain Commander of the	Port Suame City guard. </p><P>Clockwise sits the Firelord, as second councellor in this session. He is Salt	Peter, the father of that <a href="maja.html">Maja</a> woman of Port Suame. How odd that his	daughter is a human, and he wears the flesh of faerie elfar.</p><P>The third councellor is from the Isle of Sleep, a Dark Childe. If	<i><a href="hermione.html">she</a></i> sees you, you will be found out. You lean back in your chair,	hiding behind the head of your mentor. It is good <i>she</i> did not arrive	after your mentor.</p><P>Next clockwise sits the fourth councellor, a dead lady. She is dressed	in green, the same rotting dress she died in, and has she&#146;s worn for	the last two centuries. Her necklace is new: looks like polished white	teeth. Perhaps they were once part of her ex-lover&#146;s head.</p><P>Next to your mentor on your right is the fourth councellor, a man you do	not know: he is <i><i>er per&#146; henne</i></i>, has never died, and has never been	psionically aware. He has, however, had the eyes burned from his	face with a hot poker. The scars are interesting in profile. He	wears robes, which can be deceiving.</p><P>Your mentor, Champagne of Twelfth Dream, is the sixth councellor. She	thinks you are a Darkling Illuder, and expects to be deceived, making	things easy for you.</p><P><a href="sharra.html">Sharra Decameron</a> sits to the left of your position in seventh position.	You are certain she does not recognize you.</p><P>Next is the Archdruid Heron, who once slew your brother and two sisters	over who could protect an <i>Iahklu</i> better. Obviously his claim was superior,	but the inconvenience still rankles. <i>Who does he think he is, Lady Kannon?	Self-righteous druids</i>...</p><P>The ninth member of the council is that <a href="morgan.html">woman</a> of	mixed-lios heritage. She never looks at The Firelord directly, and he never	looks at her. She is thoroughly cloaked from your psionic perceptions. When	you first saw her enter, she smiled at you, and held a finger in front of	her lips. She is unknown, but at least she keeps your secret.</p></font><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding-0>	<tr>		<td valign=middle align=center width="75"><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center width="75"><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center width="75"><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Petros, Lord Vlad Drakulya</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center width="75"><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Firelord Salt Peter</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center width="75"><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Half-lios Woman</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center colspan=3 rowspan=3><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial"><img height=225 width=225 border=1 src="../images/xparent.gif"</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Dark Childe</font></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Archdruid Heron</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Dead Lady</font></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Sharra Decameron</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Lord Barrett the Blind</font></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">Champagne of Twelveth Dream</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>		<td valign=middle align=center><font size=-2 face="helvetica, helv, arial">&nbsp;</font></td>	</tr></table><P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	Lord Barrett raps a wooden hammer on the stone table. &#147;The Burgundy	Council is in session.&#148; He glares at Lord Petros. &#147;Now what is more	important than this Kayleigh woman who bears the emperor&#146;s child?&#148;</p><P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	&#147;It&#146;s still not proven to be his.&#148; says the dead woman in green.</p><P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	&#147;Kayleigh plans to retire to Bird Keep,&#148; says the half-lios who	knows your secret. &#147;You&#151;we can&#146;t reach her in an <a href="abelard.html">Abelard Sanctuary</a>.&#148;</p><P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	&#147;We have over seven months to deal with the High One&#146;s heir,&#148; says	Salt Peter. &#147;There are more pressing matters in contention.&#148;</p><P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	&#147;Seven months to kill the child, you mean,&#148; says your mentor into	her hand.
