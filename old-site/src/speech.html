The older Eressenes are wary of change but not hostile.I assemble all the Eressenes, and stand before them in full battle array:armor, Galahad Shield, Iss Hogai and Tol Eressea. I sense their confusionand excitement. Beginning from simple calm assurance, I subtly change mybody language over a few minutes to the rigid bearing of a Paladin preparingfor War, so that it even shows in my eyes. Then suddenly, I boldly draw forthIss Hogai and shout "For Life!" I stand rigid, the Sword held high. I letthem experience their fear or zeal or confusion. Then I slowly lower theSword, and return to my original calm, assured stance."There is no Ragnarok.""Or even if there is, it doesn't matter. _Life_ is not a battle to be won;to even think of it that way guarantees eventual defeat. _I_ have thoughtthat way. Did you know? I was wrong. Once I restored to life everyonekilled in a war across an entire continent. They immediately turned back tothe slaughter. We are healers, but we must be healers of both bodies andsouls. Those who come to us seeking eternal life out of fear of death aremore wounded in spirit than in whatever bodily ailment brought them. Life isnot the same as not dying. Life is _living_."I pause. Then I remove the armor and lay the shield aside reverently. Iremove all my weapons and lay them with the armor and shield, though I keepthe unsheathed Iss Hogai. I move to a pair (man and woman) of young Eressenesand speak to them personally, though in a way so all the rest feel included."You know the stories. You know the power of Iss Hogai. But I tell youtruly: there is more power of Life here," laying my hands above theirgenitals, "and here," laying my hands above their hearts, "than in anyholy artifact or relic. This morning I stood at the grave of a woman slainby a Morganti weapon. It would destroy Iss Hogai forever to even attempt toresurrect her; perhaps it would succeed. Should I do it? But how manyhundreds have been slain thus? In a war, Death is the only victor.""But look." I lead them to a mother and newborn child. "See here the powerof Life to create and the power of Love to strengthen. Here is where deathis shown to be the lesser power. A life filled with Love is never wasted, nomatter how tragic its end. A life without love is a tragedy, no matter howlong." Recalling my son's conception and birth, my voice betrays emotion.I indicate the armor, shield and weapons. "These have their place for you.Defend life, yes. Remove the instruments of death as lies within yourcapacity. But make life worth living. Befriend the lonely; calm the angry;comfort the sad; teach children joy; reunite estranged families; find love."I'll spend time with them, getting to know them better as people. If thereare doubts, fears or concerns, I'll work to understand them. I'll share inorganized rituals and impromptu get-togethers. I want every individual tobe motivated in the direction that best complements their abilities anddesires, and best heals their fears and works within their limitations. Theleaders are not forgotton; effective leadership and guidance are criticalskills needed by the Eressene organization.</font></pre><ul><li><a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a><li><a href="churchtroy.html">Church of Troy</a></ul></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
