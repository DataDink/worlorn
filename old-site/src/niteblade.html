He bore a plain metalcirclet on this brow as a crown, and wore the galvorn metal chain mail of adark childe nobleman, similar to the armor worn by Llew under his cloaks.The apparition fingered a brooch holding its cloak shut. "I bind andcommand thee: speak to me thrice truly! Art thou Nightblade, known asKnight Founder of the Free Ranger Hall? said Llew.<p>"I am," said the apparition. The figure extended its arm, and probed forwardwith its sword, a foot above the grooves Llew had traced ... Blue sparks flaredfrom the tip of the sword to the hilt, tracing a spider web's pattern along theblade. The apparition withdrew his weapon from the rune, although both appearedunharmed.<p>"Art thou willing servant and Archangel of Shal Omnis?" said Llew.<p>"I am," said the apparition. It raised its empty hand to adjust the plaindiadem on its head, and frowned. It moved its shoulders in small circles:Vlad recognized them as lossening exercises he used before swordplay.<p>"Wilt thou enter to a land that knows not the nurturing had of Shal Omnis,and once here, assist those creatures good and just, we creatures of thelight, that we might bring renewed life back to a dying land?"<p>"I will," said the apparition, sheathing its sword.<p>"Know then, I am Llewellyn ap-Owen, and although I am known as Greater Princeof the Evil Drow Devils, I summoned thee for this purpose. Know that oncesummoned and released in this place, you shall have freedom to act as you will,for I vow never to use the summoning name against you ...I free you of allbindings to your past!"<p>Llew knelt swiftly, even as he spoke the last word, and extended his left indexfinger into the groove of the rune. All candles went out, including the stubLlew still held. The figure Nightblade reeled a moment as if stuck, moaning.He fell to one knee, hand going to his now naked brow.<p>"Welcome to the Wastelands of Worlorn," said Vlad, approaching the two ....</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475"><h3>From Qhighlandr@aol.com Tue Apr 18 19:57:43 1995</h3>Roland: I'm glad you stopped to talk to me.

I had turf beforeentering this world. It was known as South Mestea Isle and it contained alarge populous of dragons ... a majority of them were green dragons but therewere reds, golds, and the like. Llue. thought the South Pole was a possiblesight for that turf in this world. Threnody seems to agree. However, Rolandcalls the South Pole his home. Question. Is the South Pole, in youropinion, the best choice for turf or is there another island near the polewhich meets this criteria. Would it be better to get the focus then let thefocus "pull" me towards my turf?thanks for any assistance ...N.<P></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
