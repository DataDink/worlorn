One by onethey remove their headbands, each of the five elves, and begin to squeezethem, wring them out into a wooden bowl.<p>"What price?" asks Ryndall. "How will you pay for the flesh?"<p>"After all we;ve done for you," says one-hand.<p>"Full fathom five, my father lies." says the holy man, wringing hisheadband to the last moisture. The liquid from his headband is stainedpink, with your blood. Alone of all the Lios Elfar,  the Priest Marcellusties his headband back around his head.<p>"We've helped you. How can you repay us?" asks the Queen. Her hand is onher sword. With her bald head and your Doomgiver clothes, She looks likeDoctor Scofflaw ready to begin torturing one of his prisoners.<p>Hoosker just stares at you, untying his headband, and flips it into thebowl without wringing it out.<p>"We're finished here." says the leader, Ryndall. They start to walk intothe marsh, away from you.  The Kimdiss has finished packing away all thebelongings, those of the elves plus your own, into his own bedroll. TheKimdiss called Crimson puts your Chest of Bottles on the magic disk. Helooks apologetically towards you, shrugging while walking backwards as theband walks away from you, into the blizzard. Crimson waves once.<p>You let them go, bending down over the bowl of liquid. You can see yourface in the bowl, like a mirror. You see the face change from yours to yoursister's over the course of a minute or ten. Dark hair turns to light, thincheeks fill into a round face. She's speaking to you, Sam's sayingsomething special you need to hear. "What?" you ask. "I can't hear you," youcry.<p>"Don't let them get away." says the Doctor, at your side. "How can I findthem if you're not with them?" You draw your weapon and  dance it into asword, to cut. It won't keep him away forever, but cuts always make him goaway. Doctor Scofflaw stands there smiling as you cut off his head. Hissmile doesn't change as you slice his neck, not as he falls face down intothe snow, and not as his headless body reaches down to pick up his headfrom the snowdrift. "We're finished here," says the evil Doctor, whileholding his head on his shoudlers again. "You need to leave."<p>You turn to flee, and bump into Diswal. She plucks up the bowl from the airas you drop it. You dance the Weapon into the axe, and slice her armInstead of her wrist, your own shatters into bones and blood. She looksinto the bowl, oblivious of your attack. "Hey" Diswal cries, "Sam asked for<b>ogre</b> sweat, not Elf!' She glares at you, dumping the bowl into the snowwhere the pink waters mingle with drops of your blood. "You know whathappens when Sam gets mad."<p>Diswal turns into Samantha, shapeshifting before you. ""Dearest sister,"she says. Her smile is the same as Doctor Scofflaw, her eyes the same asthe one armed elf. From a scabbard on her belt, Sam draws a sword made outof wood. "My dear sister, you've failed me again..." she moves close, andyou cannot move.<p>"No," you cry. "I really tried!"<p>"We're finished here," she says. "Say hello to Mother and Father for me."Samantha lifts the sword above her head and brings the blade down,slashing, towards your face.<p>-mgg 980315	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">taimarra&#146;s <a href="taimarra_0.html">first dream</a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
