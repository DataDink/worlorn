These innocents have much torecommend them, and I speak for them as long as they do allow me.Your eyes and heart may recognize the similarity of siblings in the fourFingers of this Hand, and you would not be mistaken. These are the laterchildren of Rilea, introduced in order of age: Ryndall the strong,Marcellus the pious, Mestea called Misty by her brothers (perhaps for herattempt at a mysterious nature), and the youngest is curious Uscar.These four emerged from the grove of Rilea this year, at her discretion.The siblings were met nearly at once by my smallest hand, but regrettablyonly after travelling a number of days with neither the wisdom of the Quaalancestors nor the guidance of Rilea! Although Ryndall has now the Swan ofLorien, as well as the Mark of Quall given by me to his name, it was thewisdom of his six score years alone which delivered his group to my hand.I recommend the wisdom of our ancestors pass to these siblings. Nell hasnurtured Ryndall in the ways of the Quaal forests which were seeded by noless than those known as the Hand of Orion. My priest Pius Luck has foundMarcellus an apt pupil, if remarkably ignorant of much of our ways (whichhas taught Beryl a measure of humility--much past due I must observe!).Brendan teaches Mestea a certain line of study begun by one of our own,Foresh, who had some time ago left the wisdom of the Quaal ancestors behindfor the riches of the cities. And while Rilea seeded her youngest two withher mage's gifts, Misty takes after Brendan and Uscar is very much kin toVoid, who you might recall from a crossing of your own path some sixdecades past during the time of the death speaker (Void was the young ladywho spoke directly to you about destroying the scrolls without study!). Thesibling children of Rilea are worthy receptacles of much wisdom of theelders.These children of Rilea have seen but eleven decades, and I think theyshall see that same amount more if they do not conspire to visit Nolerakimmediately. I speak for them, and they listen to the Quaal ancestors, butthey may be bold at times enough to speak their own minds. Please do nothold their ignorant words against them. Do not forget they are not of theQuaal or Swan, but children of Rilea, and we have seen only one such childbefore.-The Thumb, Dor Shall, had the pleasure of meeting Rilea's children beforethey were introduced to the Hand I had sent as their first discovery.Dor Shall comes to you through Quaal but born a neighbor, from Brein, withno less qualification than being receptable of the teachings of honoredThorizen. But prepare yourself to have a serious discussion with this youngBladesinger. It is with heavy heart that Dor Shall displayed to me hisburden includes the Midnight Sword, for his teacher sings no more. Yes, itis so; my seer Coriander assures me that she has seen with her own sorceryThorizen's act of giving up the Midnight Sword to Dor Shall's care. We havesorrow.Dor Shall will have come to you through Fernan Solar, for I have given D. aletter of introduction for her, also. I granted Quaal's young Bladesingerleave to take up Thorizen's burden, and recommmended the wisdom of theQuaal be shared with this young Dor Shall. I have no expectation that F.'steacher will appear after so long an absence. It is fitting that theMidnight Sword once again dance next to the Oaken Sword. Ah! Would I onlyhave the leave from my duties to see this happen under the Sun of Nolerak!Perhaps after consideration of this entire letter you could shareinformation with Mikael; it may be that he would grant these two youngBladesingers the presence of the Ivory Sword of the Swan for a lesson.If time and events permitted, I certainly would have come myself to delivermy greetings as well as a personal obersavtions about these guests.Unfortunately, recent times have conspired to produce many strange eventsthroughout the forests which our beloved Nolerak has left in my care. Ihave been utterly distracted from hosting these new visitors now beforeyou, because of the events I am about to relate.In the last moons, no fewer than twenty hands have returned and reportedinteractions with the Traveller's kav elfars! There have been visits bykethi from as far as Braith holdfast, as well as a numerous recent meetingswith our mutual neighbors the Glowstone. Apparently the Braith haveaccepted a Black Decade mentioning a certain heir of one outrider village,a small enclave just recently visited by Anaka tribe Orcs on their journeyto and from Bird Keep, where they collected souvenirs and retreated swiftlyto the sea. Lorien has seen the village in question, and no doubt haspondered the lessons contained therein.It is fortunate that Grisnok's people were offended by the AnakanPellinese, for Grishnok himself came from the desert leading his peopledisplayed openly in numbers such as could be counted on at least 50 hands,The two-eyes had their vision set south where they took passage onPhoenician vessels, presumably towards Josten Port itself. You may recallthat Grishnok and Rilea are well aquainted.One of my smallest hands has also reported activity in the vicinity ofRilea's home, about the time of her children's departure. Damon Maker'sgargoyles appear to be flying nights, perhaps searching for a lost comradeor surviver of a raid. Other strange and wonderous events are occurring atthe moment, but I refuse to bore you with details when your own concernsare no doubt able to distract you as these concerns plague my attention.-If you have time in the next days or nights, I shall ask of you the trivialfavor that you turn to your famous library and examine certain records ofthe past. Rude as it may be, I have an insatiable curiousity, as you wellknow, and recent events have given me cause to have need of and call uponyour vast written resources. If you could find a generosity of spirit whichallows you to examine the histories on my behalf, I have no doubt at allthat some moments in repose and research would immediately serve you aswell as myself.The legends of ta'veren, the dreamers, concern me. It causes me interest toknow that there may possibly exist persons in these forests who at once canlearn from dreams as well as people who cause the world to change inexercising their simplest desires. My meagre memory delivers to me a beliefthat there are two styles of dreamer, the Iahklu, or "candidate," and theEr per'henne, or "reinforcement." It is thought that these species ofcreature are extinct, but I am ever skeptical.If a Hand were to possess even one finger to reinforce others, that Handshould know no bounds. If a Hand were to be comprised of no less than twoIahklu and three Er per'henne, then Nolerak's enemies might fall in greatnumbers, while even Nolerak's friends might tremble at their very glance.Dear sister, I shall speak no more of my own needs. Be of good cheer. Peacefly with you.Brother Q.	</font></pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
