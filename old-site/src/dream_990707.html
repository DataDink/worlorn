Perhaps she is not yet used to the crutches? Perhaps not. A chanceexists that she is lighthearted from lack of blood? You think not, and it isso. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Where is <a href="maja.html">Maja</a>?" she asks you directly, albeit with eyes closed. She is notswaying any longer, but instead stands with left foot firmly planted andcrutches slightly wider than her shoulders, grounded about a pace in frontof her foot. Her right leg ends in a bandage, where her ankle used to be.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">A chance exists that you know where the shearjashub of Maja Barusse hasgone, so you beckon Sharra with a finger motion. It is a moment beforeshe opens her eyes, but it is a moment of victory, of sorts. She seesyour gesture and begins to follow without reprimand, since the chanceexists.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">You wend your way through the guests and servants to the top of thestairwell. You pass the Dark Angels, who are following the lost honorof their clan. You pass the dead elf who lives; he seeks to regainhis honor. You pass the old women from the tall place, more concernedwith living well than with their honor. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">At the top of the stairwell, you point downwards, and a chance existsthat Sharra descends before you. A chance exists that she will not beconscious of you behind her.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">At the bottom of the stairwell, Sharra pauses to peer into the cave ofGround. It is a sphere Removed from the dirt and Protected by Groundand the Blue Star. Four torches, burning blue, are ensconced halfwayup the curved walls at each cardinal point. The shearjashub of Majalies with her body relaxed against the curved wall opposite theentrance. She blinks and smiles.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Welcome home," she says to Sharra, and Invites her friend into theSanctuary with an arm, which she continues to wave about theSanctuary. "I needed to recover a measure of peace and quiet. All ofus, we almost died at Dzur Mountain. I almost lost everyone. I didn'teven cast protections until the battle started."<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Battle?" asks Sharra. "The lich?" She hesitates in the door frame,as if uninvited.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"No." Maja shakes her head. "Overconfidence and Major Death servants.Three or four, plus invisible undead. It wouldn't have been so bad,but I haven't had to fight alone in a long time. Without yourfirepower, I'm out of practice," She shrugs. "I turned a Majordeath away, perhaps two, but Wedge saved me from another two. Hewouldn't let them take us. I think he's truly independent." <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The women pause, lost in their own thoughts. After a time, Majalooks over at Sharra and exclaims, "You're hurt! Come accept thenurturing of Brilliance, you fool mage!"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Something is odd. No chance exists for ... <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Sharra mistakes the height of the last stair and stumbles into thechamber. She makes a desolate moan as she drops her crutches,flailing about with her arms. The woman attempts to cushion herhead with her arms, but the crutches hinder her motion, and herbody begins to twist oddly, impossibly...<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Although there are no likelihood's within, you are able to changethe Decameron's body angle as it leaves the stairwell. Sharralands on her forearms and palms, not on her spine, not on herneck, nor head. The Decameron remains motionless on the Grounda moment, two, three...<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">A chance exist for you to recognize that Sharra is cursed: nochance exists that she can enter this chamber safely. This isan Illithid Curse! A Probability Curse in a fixed circumstanceto study... !<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Are you well?" says Maja, still lying relaxed, completely ignorantof the slim distance that passed between Sharra and death. "CanI give you a hand?"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Hoping for a foot," Sharra's reply is muffled from the dirt."Ambushed, Swords of Sharpness. The battle wasn't over." Sharraremains prone until Maja stands and walks over to lift her fromthe ground. "They wanted the High One as much as the child." <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Kayleigh?" Maja asks. Then, peering at you on the stair, shedemands, "Where's Rune?"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"He lost a foot with me, and a hand later on." Sharra rises,pulling on Maja's arm. The Decameron points to the crutches andbalances on her good leg while Maja retrieves them. She isshaking, but it is not from weakness in her leg. Sharra regardsyou and you see her face is pale, so pale that you see streaksbeneath her eyes. "Bird did not fall. She is ... formidable.Rune introduced me after."<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Oh," says Maja, not interested. "Is Kayleigh ... well?"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Unknown." says Sharra. "Gone. Bird said Kayleigh 'departed'moments before the attack, and refused to answer Rune's tantrum."Sharra smiles. "Madame Bird is a b-"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">No chance exists for Sharra to finish her word. A chance existsthat it was a critically important word. You will look for achance to hear it later.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"So we don't know whether the child survived?" interrupts Maja."With Kayleigh gone, what did he do?"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Sharra shakes her head, looking at the floor. "He ... 'followsthe wishes of the High One' and 'may not visit for a time.'"Sharra pauses with uncharacteristic hesitancy. "Don't make mechoose between a lie and a broken promise," she finishes. WhenMaja says nothing, Sharra and turns to face her. "He asked meto give you something." <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Maja's face brightens, banishing her frown. Sharra spreads herarms wide and lets her crutches fall. Maja looks on withoutcomprehension until Sharra leans forward to embrace her, tohug her tightly. The women remain this way for many moments.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"So he thinks he's not coming back from this one?" says Maja.Sharra remains silent. "Well, that man is often wrong." saysMaja, continuing with startling clarity in the Sanctuary, asif making Prophesy, or swearing an Oath, "One day I will haveall of his secrets." <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Maja suddenly kneels next to Sharra's injured leg. "Let's fixwhat can be fixed today." She lifts her hands to test theedges of the wounded flesh, causing Sharra to wince and sway,but not to cry out. The shearjashub of Maja Barusse looks overat you then, and lifts her holy symbol for a miracle. You nodback to her with respect before turning away to climb the stairs.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
