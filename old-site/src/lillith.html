That&#146;s the story and everyone is sticking to it. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Helen of Aeol, the Gold Dust Woman, bore twins some time in the year after			Aeol completed the Morganti weapons: a son Alexander Copis and a daughter			Lillith. Lillith&#146;s brother Alex was an iahklu personally killed by			<a href="yama.html">Yama</a>, and was seen only once thereafter,			on <a href="paths.html">the Paths of the Dead</a>. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith was born a vampire and therefore believes she is the daughter of			Vlad Drakulya. Supporting evidence exists: neither Aeol nor Helen was a			vampire, and Vlad Drakulya was rumored to have dallied with Dark Helen			for a time during the enchantments. Alexander Copis was not a vampire.			It is known that a pregnant woman who has relations with a vampire will			bear twins: one a vampire, one immune to vampirism. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Rumors suggest Dark Helen bore triplets, the third child, born dead, drained by fangs			in the womb. Stories say Helen cursed and screamed when she was told she could bear			no more children because of ... damage done during a terrible first pregnancy.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith learned the ways of men at Bird Keep, sneaking out on weekends to train			as a thief with <a href="hermione.html">Hermione</a>. Although Lillith uses her			Bird training without reserve, her only known relationship was with Nathan Stack,			founder and High Priest in the Church of the Snake. Lillith and			Stack cross trained in their fighting ways: Lillith is a trimarchi in the schools			of the Bat, Snake, and Spider, while Stack is a dimarchi Bat and Snake.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			While not known as religious, in the Cycle of <a href="dance.html">Dance</a>			Lillith has forced her matriarchy at knifepoint to turn from the spider queen			Llolth to a different evil deity named Sekkar. Lillith has never displayed any residual Dust power from hanging around			<a href="dira.html">Dira</a>, the <a href="hosts.html">host</a> of			<a href="game.html">Dust</a> in the Cycle of <a href="dreams.html">Dreams</a>.			These proper names are not to be spoken out loud by god-fearing persons.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith loves war.  It is rumored that in exchange for training in strategy			and tactics she defeated, enslaved, and sold her beautiful replicant mother			to a Stealth Master Elite named Greyson. She is always leading the Hellene			Drow in uprisings against the Dark Children who escaped the matriarchy of			the Vault of the Drow to live in Carsultyl Holdfast. Vlad Petros was heard			to accuse Lillith of assisting the Illithids attacking his place of power			during the Cycle of Dance.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith has spent much of her life harassing House Drakulya, trying to be			recognized in any manner, but Vlad Tepes did not acknowledge her, and none of his			offspring have recognized Lillith either. Lillith bears the white adamantine			i, mai, and oude of the School of the Bat, although no living Bat School			weapons instructor admits to teaching Lillith.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith always hated Aeol, before during and after he lead the uprising			against Helen. Lillith continues to hate Maeglin, her younger half-brother			sired by Aeol during an affair with Aladrahel that lead Lillith&#146;s mother			morganti-ing Lillith&#146;s father. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lillith is arguably 2nd generation Kin of Troy, peer to <a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a>,			<a href="hal.html">Hallenrakenthaller</a> and others. Replicant Blood has proven			sufficient magically, but politically Lillith is disdained by the Kin in the same			breath dismissing Dark Helen as genetic garbage, a magical accident.			Lillith and Stack have no known children.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
