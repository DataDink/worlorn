He is also known as "X," the name 		he uses when manifest in avatar. In high council, he is known as 		<a href="goldroad.html#wielder">Waldann high-Ironjade X</a>, honoring the Ironjade kethi (holdfast 		brothers) above the others: Glowstone, Braith, Taal, Shanagate, Kenn, Coalblack. He, of course, 		appears as a Kav Elf, known in some lands as Grey or High Elf.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Traveller's avatar plays a unique musical instrument, a shiny lyre-like "champagne"-blue 		instrument called a "guitar." He dislays great talent with this and any other musical instrument he 		has been seen to play. He sang many powerful songs with widespread and long-term effect, including:	<ul>		<li><b>Tune this Electric Guitar</b> - changed Heward's Mystical Organ into the Traveller's champagne blue guitar.		<li><b>Gold Dust Woman</b> - created Helen the Dark from a hair of Helen of Troy, at the request of Aeol, the Dark Smith.		<li><b>Eye in the Sky</b> - Played for the benefit of <a href="dira.html">Evil Snake god</a> in exchange for his eye.		<li><b>Magic Bus</b> - created the Traveller's chariot.		<li><b>Madman Across the Water</b> - Played for the Demonlord on the Forbidden Isle. Motivation and response unknown.	</ul>			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		When seen in battle, the Traveller is reputed to wield a sword of great power, decorated with a ruby, 		thought to be the evil Snake god's eye. When the Traveller's avatar pulls the ruby away from the hilt, 		it dangles from a mithril chain which retracts slowly. The sword sings for a time, as the chain retracts. 		When the chain has retracted fully, the ruby rests again in the setting of the hilt, the sword falls silent.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Traveller rides the Magic Bus, a Prismatic-covered horseless chariot called a "VW microbus" by 		the god. He created it with a song and a hundred pounds of english chocolate. From the outside it 		appears to seat a half-dozen persons, but while it is always crowded, the magic bus is never full.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Traveller's concubine/wife is <a href="lakedreams.html#weilder">Hermione</a>, a master thief 		and founder of a sword school. They met when the Dean of the Wisard Schoool at Isuame and the 		Chromatic dragon joined forces with them to re-establish the Empire of the Imperial Orb, with 		Necrodemus I on the Throne. 			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Traveller's avatar is often seen in the company of the founder of the Trojan Hektorite Crusaders,		and is known to favor the Church of Troy in many matters. While the Traveller has aided persons 		from all walks of life, the god is known to stand neutral in most affairs, acting only when compelled 		to restore balance in a greatly irregular situation.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">THE TRAVELLER&#146;s PEOPLE</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475">			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		In the previous cycle, roughly between 150 and 4594 years		ago, during the Time of Fire and Demons, the elfar race		deviated from being one people. The sky spewed fire and		strange beasts walked the earth. The slaver races became		extinct, as did most of their slaves. It was a time of		great danger and upheaval.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Those who would become known as the Lios Elfar would not		give up their sky, and so retired to the Forest Within		the Forest. Those who would become known as the		Phoenican Elfar retired to The Fountains of Paradise, a		land on the other side of the seas. Those who would		become known as Faerie Elfar danced with the demons		beneath the fires from the sky (and became much changed		thereby!). 			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Those who would become known as <a href="goldroad.html#race">Kav Elfar</a>, the		Traveller's people, retreated to cave-like fortresses		called Holdfasts. Because their population had been		so depleted during the fighting years before the		retreat, the Traveller's people held their childbearing		women safe at the back of the caves where they could		be found by no demon or fires from the sky. Only the		expendable men folk were permitted to travel outside		the caves. 			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		To prevent holdfast infiltration by solitary mockmen		(shapechanger demons) the Kav Elfar menfolk would		venture forth only in pairs, each man permitted to		return to the Holdfast only in the company of their		blood brother, called "teyn." Teyns would vouch		for each others' identity, a tradition which continues		to this day. Kav Elfar society and sorcery became		highly attuned to the detection and elimination of		shapechangers.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Within two generations keeping the women safe in the		back of the caves became a social norm, leading		inevitably to a second-class citizenship comprised		of females and boys below the age of maturity. The		kethi of John Coalblack buried too deeply and the		women revolted under the beteyn Eclavdra, she who		became the first Queen of the Drow.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Travel in the time of Fire and Demons was limited. The		holdfasts were geographically isolated and eventually		the distances caused great suspicion which induced		civil war. Women from other Holdfasts were often war		trophies, obtained on raids to increase the gene pool		of the kidnapper's people, and the honor of the kidnapper. 	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">THE ROAD</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475">			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The Traveller eventually created his stone roads to		magically speed the journey from one holdfast to		another, and to magically protect the journey from		the fires in the sky. However, the warlike habits of		the Kav Elfar were ingrained into their society already,		and have not changed significantly in the times since		the Road was built.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		At one time Road Travel was available to anyone who		dared set foot on the black stone. Each person who		travelled the Road was guaranteed only one encounter		on the way to one's destination, regardless of the		distance or time. Those who travelled in parties		were allowed to aid each other in the encounters of <a href="openroad.html">the		Road</a>, sharing each encounter's risks and benefits. 			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The guaranteed single-encounter magic was broken if		the Road was left. When it was discovered that the		magic of the Road could magically starve a traveller		if not enough food was carried, Huery-que-que, a		pellinese Orc once employed as Royal Chef of Wallachia,		created a series of inns called "Country Kitchens"		spaced precisely at one-day intervals at a healthy		man's foot speed. Inexpensive and well-seasoned food		is available for all races but elves, who must pay		"a million gold" for each meal, enforced by magic		which enslaves non-payers.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		For the last two hundred years the Road has been		maintained by a human Priestess Mary-Margaret		Roadgrader, who rides a horseless chariot, stranger		in appearance than than the Traveller's.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Legends indicate that originally the Road provided only		magical travel. In current times a Priest of the Road		is required to invoke the miracle of Road Travel.		Without such a priest, merchants and vagrants use		the black stone path for navigation and comfort,		although the prevalence of brigands make this not		without risk. Rumors of bonze travelling the road		without aid have died out with the teachings of		the bonze.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		There is evidence that the gods themselves use a		<a href="goldroad.html">Gold Road</a. of the Traveller to travel between the		planes. Encounters on the Gold Road are said to		be suitable deterrent to a "mere" demigod.	</font></pre></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
