This non-place was him, and he was this place. He was there in Black Place for longer then he knows how to determine. It is hard for Talin to remember Black Place, or how long time he was there, and his hands begin to shake whenever he tries to remember anything about Black Place. He left much behind there, and going back for it will cost him. <P>His memories are broken by one single image. He saw a light, a white light, and it is the only thing other than himself. When he sees White Light, Talin knows that he is not Black Place. He has never been Black Place, but Black Place wanted him to be a part of it. Talin is alonewithin Black Place, but he didn't know that. He was alone, but now he is not, there is another thing here, a not-Talin. Talin tries to approach the White Thing, but Black Place forbids this. Talin recalls what weeping is, but in Black Place there are no eyes or tears or sobs. White Light comes to Talin, comes through Black Place and then White Light is all around Talin, and Black Place receeds. <P>Talin is in White Place. White Place is better than Black Place.<P>Talin can learn things in White Place, and very soon Talin learns that White Place is made of many White Lights, not just one. Before Talin is able to communicate with other White Lights, he has a lengthyperiod, years of white light, learning how to stop paying attention to the teeming life, life, life, life, all around him, overwhelming his perception, and overpowering his mind. White Light is all around him.Talin discerns that there are separate lights, and Talin is only one of them, and with this lesson that Talin teaches to himself,he is able to restore himself, and palce himself within the White Place,and particpate in the world of the living.<P>Some lights are really bright, much brighter than the others around Talin's recovery. They are as bright as Erin is in Talin's Dreams. Talin has Dreams again. He sees people in the night when his eyes are closed. One is <a href="erin.html">Erin</a> and one is Y'Ghu. Erin and Y'ghu went away and were never part of Black Place. But this is White Place, and Erin and Y'ghu are back. Talin sees two other special lights when his eyes are open and he is awake, but the two special lights Talin sees at night are namedErin and Y'Ghu.<P>Special lights are a special part of White Place. Talin must remember to keep seeing with his eyes and hearing with his ears, and talk with his mouth when he is in White Place, or the Special Lights here won't know Talin is with them. Special Lights don't see White Place so brightly as Talin does. The Special Lights have clasps, and staves, and one has a robe, much like the dreams of Erin's clasp, and staff, and robe: the dreams of Erin here in the White Place.<P>Two Special Lights help Talin with Talin's recovery; two people teachTalin to remember to cope with White Place's everyday things, things like eating, washing, and eventually dressing and walking. They teach Talin to stop seeing the white and instead see real colors,to hear real sounds, and to stop knowing only the life all around him.Two lifes help Talin to see and to hear and to taste and to feel and to weep again.<P>When Talin is ready for talking, he has come to know the Names of the Lights who have Helped him. Talin has been taught how to be an elf again by a Woman-Light named Josie Gatmirk, and a Man-Light Aleksandir Skemandras.They weep when they first hear Talin speak his own name aloud, weep with joy, and Talin weeps with them, for he knows their lights to glow even more brightly just then.<P>Josie and Aleks invite Talin to stay, invite Talin to help them teach others from Black Place how to speak their own names again.<P>--<br>dm 961107</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
