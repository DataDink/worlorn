I found the <a href="muses.html">setof Muse statues</a> and studied them for a while. I then cleared away some unrulyfolks and staked out some <a href="turf.html">Turf</a> for people to have sweet dreams. Soon after,others staked out some Turf for their own Reign, but no one else on Worlorncould grant experience points for adventures without the statue of the Museof <a href="dreams.html">Dreams</a>, Klinure. This is why Troad fell with the Statue of the Musestolen.<p><hr><p><h2>Threnody on Worlorn</h2>"<i>. . . of all the creatures on Worlorn, only <a href="troy.html">Troy Ounces</a> (The Human One, AKA <a href="dworkin.html">Dworkin</a>) was able to gainhis Turf without having a place of ultimate power _before_ he claimed it.</i><h3>The HISTORY</h3>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Worlorn is an asteroid which is not goverened by natural laws other than those imposed by 		sentient thought. When no single being has absolute control of laws for a given area, then 		that area is called Wasteland. Wasteland is governed by the expectations of the generic 		mind, sometimes referred to as "the Most Common Dominator." <br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		When Troy Ounces discovered Worlorn, it had been charted but not visited by a Bonze 		(warrior of the empty hand) name of Celia Marcyan. Celia spoke of the asteroid while in a 		monastary Troy was visiting. The description of a world of no boundaries amused Troy to 		no end. Of course he had to visit. <br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Upon his arrival Troy found many races of strongly disciplined minds vying for power; races 		which we know somewhat of to this day: Hrun, Hee-chee, Mithreraneans (the source of 		mithril), Athelini (source of &#147;black mithril&#148;), Thrint, Dactlyoids, Monoceros 		(unicorns), and the many races of dragons. <br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		While ALL the races on Worlorn are known to be non-natives, the origins of many are 		shrouded in mystery. Generally there were two classes of beings in the Wasteland: psionic 		dreamers and foodslaves. An example of this relationship that continues to our day is the 		mind flayers dominating githyanki and githzerai.<br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Troy saw the situation on Worlorn and deemed it more challenging than he expected. So 		he drew up a plan. First he had to stake a landclaim against the other Slavers and then he 		had to enforce it. He hid his intent and power from the slavers and studied among the 		slaves for many months, perhaps over a year. That year must have been as dangerous as 		it was enlightening to Troy.<br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		. . . With the <a href="oimota.html">crown of worlorn</a>, we can command the heart to 		grant us land area and bind our muse to it without falling under the control of the heart. The 		heart is the demon amulet of the Motherlode, who is generally of a lawful good disposition 		and would not willingly give up any powers to a creature who has ever killed any creature 		intentionally. There is no f*cking way Erin of Dolkris will qualify under the Heart's rules.<br>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		This is a Tale told by Threnody.
