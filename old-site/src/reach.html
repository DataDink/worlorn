It is made available to all in the hopes that interests will be made   clear regarding the direction and effort required to awaken my lord   <a href="digriz.html">diGriz</a>.</p><blockquote>	<P>My lord diGriz is sleeping a dreamless sleep. I did not want to believe   	it until I saw it for myself.</p>	<p>Everyone made way for me to view him. . . I renewed my pledge, gave what   	honor I could. Still he would not wake for me.</p>	<p>I considered my absence from him preparation, not separation. I hope I   	was not mistaken.</p>	<p>Many people were <a href="flamespeech.html">speaking to a fire</a> outside.	I surmise my lord diGriz created that fire, which appears to burn without	consumption. It was comforting to stand near, but if I had stood any longer than I did, it   	would have been undeserved, for I do not know how to recover my lord   	diGriz. But I continue to search.</p>	<p>I have recently been enlightened that I am <i>er per&#146; henne</i>, which either   	encompasses "follower or flotsam" or "those who have more fun". I am not   	sure. My lord diGriz is not <i>er per&#146; henne</i>. He is one known as <i>Iahklu</i>,   	which encompasses either &#147;mover or shaker,&#148; or &#147;those who have to do all   	the work.&#148; I believe that it is partly because I am <i>er per&#146; henne</i> that I   	cannot wake my lord. I do not know this to be fact.</p>	<p>The facts I know them are these:</p>	<ul>		<li><p>My lord diGriz is asleep. He will not awaken.		<li><p>He appears ill, wan, wasted.		<li><p>Josie says he is resting.		<li><p>Josie also said 7 creatures who had been his friends stood against him   		before he succumbed to his sleep.	</ul>	<P>These 7 were:	<ol>	<li><p><a href="almitra.html">Almitra</a> of <a href="llewghund.html">Llewghund</a>	<li><p><a href="tanngrisnir.html">Tanngrisner</a> of <a href="troad.html">New Troad</a>	<li><p><a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a> of <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbedarn</a>	<li><p><a href="yama.html">Yama Dharma</a> of <a href="paths.html">Paths of the Dead</a>	<li><p>Paris of the <a href="fountains.html">Fountains of Paradise</a>	<li><p><a href="prince1000.html">Prince Who Was 1000</a> of <a href="watersea.html">Watersea</a>	<li><p><a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> of <a href="flambeau.html">Flambeau</a>		<P>(for some reason, Josie could not speak Threnody's name,			and Aleksander had to speak for her)	</ol>	<p>When I last crossed in the mist, I believe I met two of these entities,   	Yama and Almitra, within Llewghund.</p>	<p>Yama claims to not have known my lord diGriz or interacted with him for   	the last 4 years. I do not know if I believe him, but I cannot help but   	feel a sense of kinship and trust I do not fully understand.</p>	<p>Almitra claims she would have helped my lord diGriz if she had been in   	complete control of her demense. She claims that she is second in power.   	She claims that my lord may have mistaken her inability to help him as   	unwillingness to help him.</p>	<p>From further conversation with Almitra, I was led to believe that my lord   	diGriz wanted to move the entity that was truly in control of Llewghund.   	To where, I have not discovered. With what means I have not discovered.   	For what purpose I have not discovered.</p>	<p>I do not know if I believe her, but I sensed a certain indignance during   	the explanation of her situation. But for this I might have doubted her   	story in its entirety.</p>	<p>So far, I intuit that perhaps <i>Iahklu</i>, as movers/shakers/workers, must do   	something to awaken my lord diGriz, for an <i>er per&#146; henne</i> cannot do it   	alone. I have tried. As I speak with the others who stood against him, I   	will strive to discover what happened, and why, and how to safely wake my   	lord diGriz.</p></blockquote><P>-Reach di Kendol, pledged to diGriz</p> 	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
