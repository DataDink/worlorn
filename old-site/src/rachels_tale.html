In thisforest of light, there was light in the sky even at night. since then, insome lands, lios elfar are known as the star children. but at that time,only within the forest of the lord keebler could the lios elfar retire andbe safe.</p><p>three manlike starmages and an elven woman put an end to the dark times.they came to the world from another place unlike this place in almost everyway. the three starmages were called wink, skywalker, and baker. the elf wasnamed rilea. when he learned the world was without light, the starmageskywalker opened a gateway leading between our world and the world fromwhich he came. skywalker invited corellian larethian into the world.corellian accepted the offer to bring light to our dark world, and onceagain there was light in our world for the lios elfar.</p><p>corellian larethian incarnated and to prevent the traveller from realisinghis presence, was called nolerak. to bring the light back to the world,nolerak sired many children. to each child he gave a mark of his wisdom, andalso a mark of his wisdom was given to his friend lord keebler. rilea wasoffered the mark of nolerak's wisdom, but deferred. nolerak promised to gifther children with marks, to their last number, to the end of time. skywalkerwas granted other gifts.</p><p>the children of nolerak brought their wisdom out of keebler's forestswithin, brought the light of nolerak into the forests of the world of men.the traveller did not discover the light of the lios elfar until four of hischildren and the lord keebler had established enclaves of light in the darkforests.</p><p>at this time the traveller brought his attention to bear. kav elfar leaptfrom their caves and two by two came forth to slay any elves of light theycould find. those lios elfar with the wisdom of their elders could hideoutside the sight of the traveller's kav elfar. lios elfar who ignored thewisdom of the elders perished by the sharp blades of the kav elfar.</p><p>as time passed, the original children of nolerak grew weary of the world,and the darkness brought by men and orcs. when the moment came when theycould no longer bear the dark places of the world, each child of nolerakwould pass the mark of wisdom to the next younger child, and quit the landsof light and dark for a place of eternal light. when a holder of wisdomfound darkness before light, the mark was held by lesser lios elfar until achild of nolerak should come forth and claim it.</p><p>it is said among men that when a child of rilea came to wisdom, that thischild would find the least wise of the mark leaders, and ask that leader toquit the lands of light and darkness, and retire to the lands of eternallight. it is said among men that on occasion the unwise children of nolerakwere so foolish as to raise weapons or spells against the children of rilea,and then nolerak would come to avenge the dead. it is said among men that ofall the marks of wisdom, only the swan have never spilled the blood of thechildren of rilea.</p><p>there is no story among men which tells of four children of rilea coming towisdom at the same time.</p></blockquote><p>Rachel died of old age, shortly after relating this tale.</p>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy;
