It is good that you are alive and well!Oh Great and Glorious (I forget your Name) friend of mine from Billykin'sWorld, and to whom I owe a suit of Chain Mail! Oh, my fallen son, Kalkin the Binder!<P>Oh great and Wonderful iahklu turfholders in Worlorn. Hear me! I Am Yama Dharma, reincarnated, returned from Death's feeble grasp. I exist. Remember that, and we can be friends.<P>I am an iahklu in Llewghund who wishes to chat with the Assistant DM of Billykin's Planes about Turf Rights. My name is Yama Dharma. I believe we have met frequently over the years, although most often I was <i>er-per&#146;henne</i> instead of my current and original status as Iahklu.<P>Yama Dharman iahklu has been permitted by <A HREF="llewghund.html">Llewghund</A>'s DM to activate my Ace-in-the-Hole after my unfortunate and inexorable death in my Billykin's Turf. It appears Worlorn did not recognize my rights to use an Ace-in-the-hole, and I never desiredto ask if I might use my Insurance Point to return to Worlorn asan Er Per'henne. However, the DM of Llewghund allowed (initiated) Marlee's attempt to Hook me into Crossing-in-the-Mists as Dream 03 Yama Dharma, and I negotiated with her to leave it objectivelyindefinate whether I used an Ace-in-the-hole or (one of my two) Insurance points.<P>If Yama Dharman iahklu's Ace-in-the-hole is not sufficient to bring me back to a Billykin's plane after a Worlorn wrathman terminated my existence forever with Dyrnwyn (a Real Death?) under Worlorn Law, then Yama Dharman iahklu wishes to know if I may have the right to invoke my insurance point to come back with 999 Billykin's points, Turfless. If the Wrathman killing me in my Worlorn Turf causes me to lose my Turf under Worlorn Law, then I have come back to life Turfless, but can gain Turf immediately.<P>I prefer not to make this decision until after hearing the arguments of the Assistant DM.<P>As Er Per'henne, I was informed in no uncertain terms that thedeath of one of my incarnations by the weapon "Dyrnwyn" from Carl Cross' world (AKA Greyswandir) would "end Worlorn, endall magic....for when there is no Lord over Death then there is no magic' or some such hogash which would parallel the ending of Carl Cross' world. The issue of what magic couldrestore me to Worlorn adventuring never came up, since there would be no more adventuing if ther was no more magic.<P>Obviously there are stories here which we Iahklu must pursue.<P>Like, who is the impostor, the poseur who has been using my name and my estate for the years since Crotoan inconveniencedme? Like, Why didn't Worlorn end when I (Yama-Dharma-with-an-Illithid-Skull-in-my-head-er-per&#146;henne) was <A HREF="paths.html">killed by Dyrnwyn on the Paths of the Dead</A>. This is my last memory. Like, am I forever exiled from Wasteland and NPC turfs? Like, Am I forbidden to be an <i>er-per&#146;henne</i> again? Will I die--er, reincarnate if you please!--if I try to enter Wastelandor <i>er-per&#146;henne</i> Turf?<P>Regardless, I believe I have rights to Turf under Billykin's Law.<P>Yama Dharman iahklu earned one Billykin's point on the adventure of my 'ressurrection,' from the DM of Llewghund. (Regrettfully, I never had the chance to earn six points by stating my goal to be ressurrected.) This means that regardless of whether Yama Dharman iahklu comes to Llewghund using a Billykin's Ace-in-the-hole, or with a Billykin's Insurance Policy, Yama Dharman iahklu has 1000 or more points and therfore I am entitled to Turf under the Laws of Billykin's Planes.<P>Yama recalls no rule about losing Turf in Billykin's rules should the turf owner be slain within. Assitant DM may haveto make a Judgement Call on this issue if you have no memory. Rogue DM has the power, I presume?<P>Does the Assitant DM of Llewghund recognize Yama's rights for Turf? May Yama Dharma's one chosen entrance to his Plane be placed Freely, anywhere in the Worlorn System? Does he have to Run an adventure (as an iahklu in Llewghund, Fountains of Paradise, Dolbadarn, or Crosswinds) to 'find' the entrance? May I place my entrance Freely but limited to within a Turf of Billykin's Rules?<P>Enquiring Minds want to know.<P>Should I perhaps be setting up my Turf under the Muse of Dance      or the Muse of History instead of The Muse of Dreams? Almitra tells me that all eight of my Klinure turf-buddies are retiredor dead or gone: No Ko; No Waldann; No Karter (Kalkin); No Champion; No <A HREF="troy.html">Troy</A>; No Damion; No Keebler. I am alone, adrift,surviving the past cycle with only my Billykins Items intact.I am so very troubled by the state of the union. <P>Please help me play in this brave new world you have.<P>--<br>Yama Dharma, Iahklu.<br>Currently of Castle <A HREF="llewghund.html">Llewghund</A></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
