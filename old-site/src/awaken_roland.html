There are no intruders, no occupants but for Roland and Durendal.			He rises, disquiet and uneasy, preparing for a journey, bringing all he owns with him,			because he may not be back.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Roland may not be back? This tomb was <i>Promised</i> to him, eternally, by the one who			could promise and change the world. It was Promised, and now it is gone, like dust			in the ... like Dust against Blood. But still, it was Promised Roland would always			have a home here in the south. And now home is stolen.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Who would dare steal Tloluvin&#146;s home?		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Outside the tomb, Roland feels somewhat refreshed. It is a crisp winter day in the 			south. There is no weather but for the bright sun and cold wind. The chilled air			fills Roland&#146;s lungs, once, twice, and then he begins to jog northwards, to the sea.			His fists clench and he swings his arms in an easy four-count rhythm. The exercise			and tour jacket keep Roland warm.  He can keep the pace for hours, for hundreds			of miles.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Red dragons come into view eventually, collecting on the shore. There are none in the			air but for the ones who are landing. There must be over a hundred. Six breaths apiece;			that&#146;s a lot of dodging, even for the Grand Master of Flowers. Perhaps Durendal grants			Fire Immunity in this incarnation. Roland closes with them. Their group is the only 			feature on the plain of snow and ice. <i>Something</i> woke Roland&#146;s sleep;			<i>something</i> is gathering red dragons.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The dragons loom very large, as if Roland had slept for a long time and the growth			of no dragon had been threatened the entire sleep. Roland slows, but continues at			a fast walk, fearlessly, until he is within yards, feet. Roland avoids their eyes,			but keeps his attention on their faces. None look away from him. They hold their			breaths.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Dragons say nothing. Roland says nothing. They are afraid, but too proud. They will			die fighting before they withdraw. None of the dragons awoke Roland. They were afraid			before he arrived; their fear was gathering them on the shore. Some of them look over			the sea even with Roland within reach.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<i>Take me north</i>, Roland commands.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			An uneasy silence fills the winter day. No one breathes. Roland momentarily looks over			the waves of flux, wild and formless, knowing he cannot swim and stay what he is.			Maybe the <i>Pipe-Full-of-Fun</i> or <i>Mr. Fixit Toolkit</i>, whichever he owns			in this incarnation, maybe this item can be used to make some flux into a boat with 			oars What a boat it would be.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Motion draws Roland&#146;s attention. A larger dragon is closing, moving forward from the 			middle of the group. What were they doing? A convention? Why do dragons meet on the			edge of the sea? What would gather them in fear? The creature before you has seen 			battle, has been scarred and torn by forces great as he. This large ancient ubound			red dragon looms over Roland, who looks into his face, but does not meet his eye.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			He stares down until Roland smells sulphur in the chilled air. Roland stands			motionless for a minute, ten, and hour. The other dragons withdraw.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<i>You are Roland. I know you. I will take you.</i>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			He lowers his wing. &#147;Sobriost,&#148; he says. True Speech. <i>Mount.</i>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The other dragons watch the north uneasily as Roland alights on the winged stair,			coming to a rest behind the dragonking&#146;s head.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			What could clamp like a vise and hold terror so barely constrained in so many unbound			dragons. These dragons have no master. What seed was sown here and was it planted by			the Homestealer?		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Once he is hours aloft, with four stiff hands holding the red scales against winds no			mere monk could master, Roland&#146;s ears are assaulted by thunder in the form of a			dragon&#146;s laugh. <i>Welcome to the end of the world.</i>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Laughter bubbles from Roland, and he draws Durendal to swing her wildly above his head,			feeling suddenly more alive than ever before.		<P>		<font size=-3><i>95.03.02</i></font>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<a href="awake.html">equal and opposite</a>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
