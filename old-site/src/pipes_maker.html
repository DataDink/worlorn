As to his needs, it has little to offer. No rich, nor even scanty veins of ore reside there. No gems, nor geodes to be found. It&#146;s height in the massive mountain put if far removed from the prolific forges of his great hall. It is wholely unremarkable save for one phenomenon, one which makes the cavern useless even as a place of residence or work.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The egress of the cavern leads through a straight tunnel (well, relatively straight as tunnels go), which very gradually broadens as it progresses outward from the center of the mountain. Nearly a mile beyond the cavern, the tunnel is as broad as a castle&#146;s curtain wall and nearly as high. There is stops, to look out over the broad expanse of the Watersea from a great height with the roof overhanging the edge of the cave by some score of feet.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">So far, this is not particularly inhospitable terrain, but of it comes a freakish turn. As certain as the sunrise is marked in time, so too is the tide. The tide here, is not just the salt-spray of the sea, however. Air, too, the wind marks a tide on this shore. As the water rises, wave upon wave, so too the Wind rushes forth onto the land. As it does, it races up the steep slope of Damon&#146;s mountain home and where it reaches the cave, the overhang catches some part of it and turns it down the passage, deep into the mountain. As the wind rushes down the narrowing tunnel, it is funneled to a faster and faster pitch, until at last it blasts into the deeper cavern, wailing its primal chord like a banshee.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Damon has stood, rooted to the floor of the cavern at let the howling demon wind slip past his craggy form as he thought. At last he knew what he would do. The dwarves of the forges down below never questioned a bequest granted them by the Maker. Pieces certainly seemed meant for each other, but what they were when assembled remained a mystery to those whose rocky hands had hammer out them out. Only Damon could see the whole in his mind. Great labors were undertaken to move all the pieces up to the high cavern, especially the largest of them, but at last, all was in place and Damon began to Make sense of it all.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">He had Made a series of pipes, not unlike those of organs, serviced by a great bellows. But these pipes were far larger than any made for mere organ. And these pipes were crafted in an unusual way. To sound, a pipe would require a certain speed of wind to open a weighted baffle and at a higher speed it would close again. Thusly, untended, each pipe would sound in turn; each quieting as the next picked up its note.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The first pipe was of gold. It&#146;s baffle was slow to open and the wind would make a gentle, hollow whisper as it began, before the full, bass note sounded. &#147;HhhhhhhhhAAAaaaaaa.&#148; and when the baffle close again, more quickly than opening, the strong bass would change timber as it was strangled off &#147;aaaEEee!!&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The second pipe was of silver. It has the most unusual feature, perhaps of all the pipes. For as the sea wind raced around the metal pipes, it would condense water up on their cold shells. The water dripped from the pipes and gathered in a special silver bowl at the base of the second pipe. When the baffle opened to the second pipe, a large silver ball at the end of a lever attached to the baffle would be plunged suddenly into the bowl beneath the pipe. It sound much as any stone of some weight dropped into a deep resevoir, &#147;Gnnng&#148; (although it was perhaps more refined a tone, and a stone of exceptional material and shape to deliver it). No sooner had the ball been plunged down than a great organ bellow &#147;Oooooooooooooo&#148; would sound.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The third pipe was of Mithril. It very much resembled the first pipe in form and fucntion, save that it was delicately different, barely discernable, in shape, and had lever with a great ball on it attached to the baffle (something like that of the second pipe, but higher up and external to the pipe). So, too it sounded much like the first to start. &#147;WwwwwwwwwAAaaaaaaaaaa&#148; Here, however was a difference from the first, as the baffle closed, it caused the lever and ball to strike the pipe a great blow. &#147;Knnnnnnnnnngggg&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The fourth pipe was of copper, an simpler than the other. Its baffle, nearly without effect as the pipe began its note, but with a padding and muffler that as it slowly closed produced a smothering of the note.&#147;Iiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnn&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The fifth pipe was of brass, and borrowed from both the first and the fourth in its design. A muffler set up a great humming as the note strained to break free of the baffle&#146;s throttle on its air supply. Then at the end, like the first pipe, it would squeal out its last. &#147;MmmmmmmmmAAaaaaaaaaaaEee!!&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The last pipe was of adamantium. It had a drum on either side of it, like wheels on a cart. Inside one drum was a springy, thin piece of the metal, bent back, under tension and the inside of the drum was lined with ridges to catch the metal flange as they moved by it. The other drum was lined, likewise, with ridges, but filled instead with a great number of adamantium marbles. When the baffle would start to open, a hammer would fall and strike a plate &#147;Ddddd&#148; which released the first drum to turn with the wind, very fast for just a moment &#147;Rrrrrrrrrr.&#148; Then the pipe would sound, &#147;Eeeeeeeeee.&#148; The closing baffle would cut off the note, but set the pipe to humming, &#147;Mmmmmmm.&#148; It reset the hammer and released the second drum, &#147;Zzzzzzzzz.&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Now early to mid morning, and in the evening, The great mountain sounds. So loud are the pipes, so fierce the wind that drives them, they can be heard far and wide, even in the depths of the stone of Kaldamaaren. As if the mountain itself had a sonorous, bass voice, speaking slowly.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;AAAaaaaaaaaaEEee!!&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;GgOooooooooooooo&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;WwwwwwwwwAAaaaaaaaaaaKnnnnnnnnnngggg&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Iiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnn&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;MmmmmmmmmAAaaaaaaaaaaEee!!&#148;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;DddddRrrrrrrrrrEeeeeeeeeeMmmmmmmZzzzzzzzz.&#148;<br>&nbsp;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Inscribed in the pipes is the following verse:<br><pre>In the middle of the night,I go walkin' in my sleep, from the mountains of faith,to the river so deep.I must be lookin' for somethin'somethin' sacred I lost,but the river is wide,and it&#146;s too hard to cross.Even though I know the river is wideI walk down every evening and I stand by the shoreI try to cross to the opposite sideSo I can finally find what I've been looking for.In the middle of the night,I go walkin' in my dreams, from the valley of fearto the river so deep.I must be lookin' for somethin'taken out of my soul.Somethin' I'd never lose.Somethin' somebody stole.I don't know why I go walkin' at nightBut now I'm tired and I don't want to walk any more.All it does is take the rest of my lifeto finally find what I've been lookin' for.In the middle of the night,I go walkin' in my dreams, from the jungle of doubt,to the river so deep.I must be lookin' for somethin'somethin' so hard to findIt can only be seenby the eyes of the blindIn the middle of the night.I'm not sure about a life after this,god knows I've never been a spiritual man.At time I cry my way to the river that runsthrough the promised land.In the middle of the night,I go walkin' in my dreams, from the desert of the truth,to the river so deep.We all end in the ocean.We all start in the stream.We're all carried alongby the river of dreams.In the middle of the night...</pre></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski, portions &copy; Billy Joel<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
