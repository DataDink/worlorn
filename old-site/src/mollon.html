When Mack stuck his head inside the tree it was less than ten feet across.

He seemed quite taken aback that we recognized him, but he denied a previous meeting only once before asking questions about our memories.

Carlos of Elidor was mentioned, as well as the traveller. Mack seemed dismissive hearing that they thought the traveller or his Road was responsible, and said time-travel was not the traveller&#146;s way. They spoke of the road taking people to other times, which Mack did not contradict, but he remained dismissive. This was when Ryndall mentioned Carlos of Elidor, as the King of the North. There was extended discussion of whether Carlos ruled in the North or the South of Elidor, and then the Jester stopped pursuing the past.<br>		</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;">Mack announced he wanted us to sign contracts in our blood. our promise was to sleep through some event he could not explain, for which we would be given something beyond our imaginations. Of course, Ryndall quibbled about how we could ask for anything in that category, forcing Mack to admit that we&#146;d have to be limited by our imagination then. Much attention was given for a remarkably short time to what this was we were bargaining away.

Mack narrowed down Ryndall&#146;s		intentions		like a gardener weeding a familiar garden.

Ryndall or Mestea asked Mack if this 		was what he had done to Ryndall, but Mack did not appear to understand.		They explained that Mack had shown the ability to force Ryndall to		dance,		and asked Mack if he could not just force us to sleep instead of		make us sign contracts in blood.		<br>		</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>		<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A discussion ensued about metaphysics: good guys and bad guys, and 		the mythical Blood and Dust, in which Mack believed enthusiastically.		Mack claimed the lich you fought was trying to ally himself with Dust,		and that Joree of the Flames was allied with Blood.
