It was Turf until the Ko body died.<p><i>Why did Sethra have to remove Ko from her Game plan?</i>Not have to. Because he was there. Because she could.<p><i>IS there any old Gods on the Wasteland?</i>Not unless you count Threnody, Naminanu, Damon Eternal, Ozzy Fudd, Morte,etc. Ddefine old god. Is the Half-elven one an old god or is Oberon? Piscator orKo?<p><i>Will the Sherjashub of Ko come from the Dung pits?</i>No. Sethra lied; when a creature is de-throned by a Sword of the Wasteland,there is no reminant to come from the Dung pits. She must have had anotherAce in the Hole. Maybe that's why she kept Hannibal Lecter around.<p><i> What could be done for the Sherjashub of KO (if anything)  to help it regain its former perspective? </i>If one had remained, he/she/it may have assumed a majority of Ko's power viaingesting the ash and phlogisten gas produced at Ko's demise.<p><b>Subj:	Re: Hey MarleeDate:	95-04-01 03:43:26 EST</b><i>Hey Marlee, who trahsed Musquol?
