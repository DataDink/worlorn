Breaking the rules implies that you are no longer playing the game.<P>  Conversely, if you "break" the rules and are still playing the game,  either the rules have changed to accomodate you, you never broke a rule  in the first place, or you had been or are currently playing a different  game from the one you believed you were playing. Everyone is either a  player or a non-player.<P>There are two choices available to players: passive and active. Passive  players are impacted by and/or have an indirect impact on the game.  Active players are both impacted by and have a direct impact on the game.There are two choices available to non-players: non-participant, and  controller. A non-participant is not impacted by and has no direct or  indirect impact on the game.<P>A controller may be of two types: permissive and absolute. The permissive  controller makes allowances so that they may occasionally play the game.  The absolute controller chooses not to participate at all costs, and only  seeks to establish the rules by which all players must adhere. Any player  is potentially a controller.<p><li>There are at least six ranks of existence. I have personally  interacted with a sixth rank of creature; the rest of the world only  suspects that six ranks exist.<P>Given this fact, there are at least 7 ranks of controllers. Whether there  is more than one controller at any given level is another matter  entirely.<P>To my knowledge, no controller at 5th rank or higher has died an  irrevocable Real Death. The Real Death has no meaning to any creature of  less than 5th rank. The wathan is consumed, but the controller of the  wathan persists.<P>[This means that <a href="ko.html">Ko</a> is not dead, and has never died. It was not  possible.]<p><li>Reality is always in flux.<p><li>Reality is always balanced.<P>The fact that reality exists is testament to it's inherent balance.  Mother Nature will not permit existence without balance. At the very  least, there have always been positive and negative energy, and Chaos and  the Void. These four agencies are largely uncontrolled. I have not  explored the poles of "that which is not energized", "that which needs no  energy", "that which is always Named," "that which is not Named." I  believe that these eight energies, at least, will always exist to some  degree, ensuring an enduring balance for reality.<p><li>The balance would exist without Roke.<p><li>Roke is not superfluous to the balance.<P>What is the balance? Ah, the incredible obtuse question. The balance is  that which without we would not be able to exist. Awfully self-serving,  eh? Well, mortals are like that. Even monster mortals. We'd all like to  survive. The balance gives us a reason to survive, and the rationale to  survive. There is no magic to it, there is no real power.<P>The balance is derived from an understanding of one's place in the  universe, and how to maximize our potential within that place. It was  Troy's task<p><li>The rules of reality are not arbitrary.<p><li>The rules of reality are undefined.<p><li>Defining reality limits possibilties.<p><li>Obscuring reality generates possibilities.<p><li>The struggle for power is contention is in amassing rules to benefit  oneself or one's agency.<p><li>The struggle for power is irrelevant to defining reality.<p><li><br></ol></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
