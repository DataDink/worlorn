He is somehowrelated to the Demonlord -- in fact, when he left Hissarlik he tookthe same name as the Demonlord. He has special anti-lawful powers,something like the powers Eressea has over Ground. His home wasat the South Pole. I'd hazard a guess that he was evil; he certainlywas someone to be wary of. None of my characters ever knew himpersonally, so maybe he's really a nice guy. If Chrysofar's lookingfor someone who can make things happen outside the normal rules,Roland may be her man.<P><font size=4><b>From TroyOunces@aol.com Sun May 14 20:05:32 1995<br>Subject: Nobody Likes me?</b></font><P>Roland says he is <I> Looking forward to profitable meetings. Some would say  Roland is a cold, brutal, unstable, psychopathic, paranoid, sarcastic killer. Roland would say "I am not sarcastic ."  He is trying to learn the art of subtlety. </i><P><font size=4><b>Subj:  As one looks, so is one seen<br>Date:  95-05-19 07:25:39 EDT</b></font><P>Roland casts his attention forth from the Forbidden Isle:<P><i> I would also like to spy on Nightblade,  Chrysofar, and Erin. One at a time. </i><P>Niteblade is at Dolbadarn with Threnody, Vlad Tollenkov, and a sentientcompanion "Realorin" who is aware of Roland. Realorin nods in Roland'smetaphorical direction as it prods Niteblade to awareness. Niteblade isinterrupted from a conversation with the Blood Phoenix about crowns of mightand elder titans when Roland turns his attention to Niteblade. Threnodysmirks as Roland is noticed. Tollenkov is utterly clueless. Eressea isawakened.<P>Realoran makes certain that Chrysofar is aware that Roland was spying onQniteblade, too. "Bummer, isn't it?" says Threnody to Roland. "You might justthink Sentient Realoran was waiting for you since Musquel, wouldn't youjust?" Realoran frowns at Threnody, who continues to smirk shamelessly in hisitem-granted dream-competence.<P>Realorin's assistance is superfluous. Chrysofar is aware of Roland's directattention instantly and unavoidably due to a certain ambiguous symmetry theyshare. <P>Chrysofar is at Diaspar. The fellow Chrysofar is with, Tanngrisner (yetanother damn incarnation of Roland's first god Troy Ounces) pays learneddream-competent attention eagerly towards Roland. Contact. First Tanngrisnerappears both shocked and brokenhearted, then he shields himelf and Chrysofarfrom Roland's (and Realorin's) awareness. This shielding is invokedperfectly, but for a finite duration.<P>With this act proven to be in Diaspar at this time, near-Sentient Morgan laFaye becomes aware of the intense dreaming activity. "Oh hey!" says Threnody,as he returns his attention swiftly to the mundane within Dolbadarn.<P><font size=4><b>Subj:  So I'm the bad guy now?<br>Date:  95-06-03 14:57:06 EDT<br>From:  TLOLUVIN</b></font><P>So now it's "let's go to the South Pole and take what some else has created." Gee, some idiot phrophesized it so it must be true. Well, if you must come,be forewarned. It will be beyond your worst nightmares and fears. Therewill be much blood and soul shredding and death and drek and creatures withnasty pointed teeth. And then when you actually make it to the Pole.....well that remains to be seen. I don't recall putting this real estate up forsale, but then again I'm not a theiving elitist kin. No offense Hektor.Let's do lunch.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
