Three of the seven remaining turfs		fielded armies of mind flayers. The <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> drove forth his Khansmen from		the Paths of the Dead, cooperating in all ways with the Florentines fielded		by his son, the Grey Lord, out of the District of Columbia. The Traveller's		Nightmare aided their armies with free passage throughout the Wastelands		with his <a href="goldroad.html">Gold Road</a>. These three Dominators had been among the first to		implant Illithid skulls.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		It was the end of the Cycle of <a href="dreams.html">Dreams</a>, and no one was Inspired to believe		there would be a Cycle to follow. Crossing-in-the-Mists offered Inspiration		to no <i>Iahklu</i>, to no <i>er-per&#146;henne</i>. The <a href="troad.html">Lands of Troy</a> had fallen to Odysseus'		black deed, and the <a href="halfelven.html">Half Elven One</a> had fallen to the Illithids of <a href="troad.html">Troad</a>.		Terpsichore, the <a href="muses.html">Muse</a> of <a href="dance.html">Dance</a>, had succumbed Fuzzy Pink, pinqued by the		Warlord Marlee. No one thought <a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a> had any hope. People only sought		to survive as long as possible before all creatures were enslaved for		breeding food. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		No one could Cross-in-the-Mist freely without a chance to meet soldiers		from a mind flayer army. The Khansmen slew with great two-handed battle		axes of Redsteel. Florentines shredded their prey with twin rapiers of		the same deadly metal. Every Kav Elfar seemed to be from the Redsteel		holdfast, wielding longswords and honor weapons mined from their mountain.		Their mind flayer probability control guaranteed deadly accuracy, and		maximal wounds.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Travel between the turfs was dangerous and fraught with disaster. Wilderness		encounters were invariably deadly. The <a href="goldroad.html">Gold Road</a> was oddly preferred, for		probability control does not determine encounters on the <a href="goldroad.html">Gold Road</a>. This		is not to say that the road travel was any safer than before the Traveller		implanted his Illithid skull. Road travel simply did not allow mind		flayers to guarantee encounters. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Near this time, <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a> la Faye and the Phoenix had created Novus Mundi,		in which those consumed by Illithids could appear to <a href="dreams.html">Dream</a> again. <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a>		had cleverly created a mechanism to allow skulls to project memories of		singular entities consumed by each Jade Skull. The Phoenix caused these		projected memories to be reborn in flesh and blood of their true Inspiration.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		I'm sorry to say Crimson, but the memories of Illithids never become true		beings, were never able to walk a <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a> for restoration. Projected		memories like you were never able to cast shadows of their own.  From		all of <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a>&#146;s memories, from all of <a href="llewellyn.html">Llewellyn</a>&#146;s notes, we had discovered		no way to restore an Illithid projection to full Inspiration, nor had we		found how to force an Illithid Skull to project an <i>er-per&#146;henne</i> memory.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		We studied these memories to ascertain what the mind flayers had learned		from our fallen comrades. As they explored Novus Mundi, we watched them		reveal their skills, allowing us to better predict the next jaded army		strategies. Some few of the skulls revealed the personalities of those		who Implanted the skull, which allowed a greater window into the enemy's		tactical ability. We explored the skull-projected beings, but our research		ended abruptly when Severian brought the Real Death to Novus Mundi. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		In a rage, <a href="llewellyn.html">Llewellyn</a> ap Owen threw <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a> la Faye into the Sea of Chaos.		What may have been <a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a>&#146;s only hope was ended in the heat of a moment.		<a href="llewellyn.html">Llewellyn</a> bore <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a> over my balcony and into the waves of chaos when		he learned Severian had entered into Novus Mundi wielding Terminus Est,		and had used the blade to end a life. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		In my time, <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a> was never more than a mercurial vision, seen but not		believed: a momentary dragon form, or woman&#146;s face in the waves below		my window in <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Although I've never forgiven the Phoenix, I believe <a href="morgan.html">Morgan</a>&#146;s fate was		better than <a href="llewellyn.html">Llewellyn</a>'s. It is said that eventually the Phoenix rose		from the Sea of Chaos, but for all the hours I sought his form in the		waves, I was not there to impose law and order within him.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> was waiting. The <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> Implanted a jade skull as soon		as the Phoenix rose from the waves, and thus formed <a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> on the		sturdy rocks of <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		We immediately began to try to awaken a secret Nightmare of <a href="llewellyn.html">Llewellyn</a>,		but the <i>Iahklu</i> refused to Cross-in-the-Mist. From that moment, when		<a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a>&#146;s <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> and Phoenix were both Illithid, the Mortal Coil		was no longer.  No chance existed for resurrection, a path for		reincarnation, or re-Inspiration. All deaths became the Real Death.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		The only blessing in the dark times was that implanted Illithid skulls		were non-cooperative with other skulls, armies, and true Illithids.		None of the armies were willing to cooperate and perfectly Dominate		one of the four remaining Turfs, or even perfectly dominate a wasteland.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Only <a href="hermione.html">Hermione</a> seemed to realize the Illithids perfected a probability		with Turf cooperation. It was unproven, but known that <a href="hermione.html">Hermione</a> Inspired		mind flayers with the corrupt <a href="muses.html">Muse</a> of <a href="dance.html">Dance</a> created by Vlad Drakulya's		Nightmare. Evidence suggested that the Khansmen and Florentines and		Redsteel were able to gain Inspiration, and thus their soldiers increased		their chances to prevail in a given situation. Armies grew in power and		numbers from all three Illithid-dominated turfs.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Among our studies of Novus Mundi we learned that projected memories		could be used by Illithids as undetectable familiars to do their bidding.		We set Salt Peter to guard the gate to Novus Mundi with The Fire Sermon.		When Maeglin defeated him, stole the Weapon of the Wasteland, and slew		the Buddha, we had no recourse to prevent jaded ones from collecting		the projected memories from Novus Mundi and releasing them as spies.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Despite the Protections of <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>, in my time the family Trump displayed		only dangerous places and jaded kinfolk. The locations depicted by Trump		cards were invariably patrolled by Illithids, Kav Elfar, Florentines, and		Khannish. And the personalities? The <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> took special pleasure in		overseeing the devouring of all depicted Trojan family and friends, one		by one. The <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a> then raised the uninspired flesh as members of his		own army, as if implanted with Illithid skulls like his own. Like a		snowball rolling downhill, the numbers of the fallen only increased. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Although the devoured Kin didn't implant jade skulls to become mind flayers,		we called them jaded. This was a description of their attitudes rather than		for the color of their bones. Whenever there was a chance for conversation		to demoralize us, the jaded Kin would tell us how resistance was futile.		Even our morale was taken from us where the chance existed.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		It seemed they were speaking the truth. There seemed no resistance that		worked. When I met you, I had just slain my fiance. He had been observed		Crossing-in-the-Mist by a jaded Kin. A jaded Kin of Troy artist had		subsequently depicted him on a new Trump from memory. This was not		uncommon; it was particularly onerous to kill loved ones who had		become turncoats, but if jaded Kin were not pursued and slain, a		chance existed that they would draw new Trump from their strongest		memories.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Mind flayers devoured the Inspiration of each cousin pictured on the		cards, until not one remained Inspired, save the few unreachable Grand		Uncles and Great Aunts on the Major Arcana. Of course, retribution from		the Patriarch was swift and invariably deadly, but Oberon&#146;s single-minded		revenge for any Trump-enabled death intimately lead to His demise by		ambush. The year before I was born, Oberon Himself fell to the <a href="yama.html">Deathgod</a>		Illithid. Trojan divine intervention was no longer known in <a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a>.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		My mother raised me by the sword, so I could always defend myself, even		when magic has a chance to fail. My father exposed me to the light of		Shal Omnis, the Queen of All Dragons, when I was but five years old.		At the time father was afraid of creating a Jefty, but my mother assured		him that exposure to an Orb of Dragon kind presented no dangers such as		presented by the defunct Trojan <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>. I remember their argument, if		not the words, for it was one of their only disagreements expressed		before me. They foolishly asked my opinion, as if a child of five		could ever turn down the chance to play with a pretty new toy held		before her.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		My father then wielded the Orb of Gold Dragons. Today as I close my eyes		I can see it as it was then: a huge ivory ball covered in gold inlay,		bigger than my head, bigger than the world. Of course, it was bigger		then to my five year-old eyes than I know it as an adult. The gold		dragons twined and moved under my father&#146;s hands when he touched it,		and he held it before his daughter whenever the spoiled little girl		asked him to. I was his only child. He showed me his Orb, and then		the ivory behind its metal facade. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		My life that followed pointed me like an arrow to fight your crusade.		I became the greatest living archive on Trojan Powers, and a Dragon		lord also. Before I was ten, my father had introduced me to the		beautiful golden creature he had Mastered by body and spirit alone,		and one day before my seventeenth birthday it deigned to speak to me. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Although the seven <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>s of Dworkin were all ... ruined, I learned		what I could of the Trojan family magic. My mother taught me to read		using the lost texts of Brandon Corey, in which the Renegade depicts		the trials and tribulations of creating Kin from replicants, of		creating the first Minor Arcana, of creating magic to affect any		manner of Trump contact, and creating one&#146;s self anew by walking		the <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>. The day after my seventeenth birthday I found Fiona's		addendum, and realized I already suspected everything she had written. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		No living woman with so little true experience had ever contained		such knowledge and power. I became liaison between the dying Trojan		Empire and the infantile Church of Shal Omnis. Although Uninitiated,		I have expertise in the Order and Law imposed by Dworkin&#146;s <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>.		Serving Shal Omnis, I have the power of good dragons to call upon		to aid any noble quest. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Eventually, to my dismay, I found myself leading the armies of		Churches in fact if not in name. The Eressenes, the Hektorites,		the Goodknights all petitioned my advice on their private issues,		a habit I found most counter productive to the fight, although		profound in the morale of my people. My time suddenly was no		longer mine to spend wielding Lansing in the field, but became		my people&#146;s time, ratifying rulings with Kuroth&#146;s Quill in my		sturdy tower.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		When I stepped from <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a> to the Wasteland for the first time		in a year, I recall Mason joking that the mind flayers had arranged		for me to be out of action. In your times, my aided perspective		now wonders how much of his joke was truth. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		During my year as Matriarch, My Soren had been ambushed, devoured,		and jaded, then returned to us in stealth. This Soren spy had		reported a valid reason patrol in the Enigmatic Forest, and his		data supported the team he deemed most likely to succeed: Soren		of <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>, Mason de Lacey, and myself. Soren waited until		nightfall of the full moon, and ... ambushed us on patrol. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		However, Soren had never believed that Lansing was consecrated in		the Blood of Shal Omnis, and able to prevail against all odds.		Although he and the Princess of the Moon could not change		probability for my weapon, Soren&#146;s own probability could be		manipulated, and my ... reactions could easily have been predicted.		If it hadn't been for the Princess of the Moon, my skill and strong		blade would have disarmed him instead of stabbed his heart. A moonbeam		blinded him at the fatal instant. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		You Elves of Starlight were the bait for the trap of the implanted		Princess of the Moon. I suppose she wanted to subtract me and my		Lansing, a sword forged of Githyanki metal and powdered Illithid		Skull, wanted us subtracted from her Shadow sufficiently to		sacrifice Soren. During my year as Matriarch, in front of all		<a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>, I had summoned her by name and demonstrated no fear		within my Sanctuary. She could not have been pleased. She let		you be seen sufficiently to tempt me out of the clearing, out		of my time and into yours for a chance to save Soren. Once		stranded, she would never let me back.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		I wonder if she considered it would make a Reece of me in your time.		Yes, presumably I have the foreknowledge to allow your world to		prevail against becoming the world of my birth. I wonder who is		the John Connor to my Kyle Reece? Perhaps it is your Shadow's		Simon Almustafa. Mine was Destroyed walking the last <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>		by the Illithid Firelord <a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a>.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		I hope a chance existed that Mason made it back to <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a>,		or at least to Fort Alexandria. He had the grievous duty to		report that the Matriarch had been lost, returning with only		her dead fiance in his arms. While this was certainly news		sufficient to decrease morale by nineteen to twenty-one percent,		I have never predicted the impact to morale if we three disappeared		without any word back to our church. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Even still, I grieve for the world for which I fight never to see		again. My faith carries me forward, against all odds, to enforce		a new cycle in which Shal Omnis restores the glory of Troy,		together prevailing against the Illithids and mind flayers that		ended my world. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Whatever the cost, we must not let <a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a>&#146;s peoples be enslaved		by mind flayers. We need to place a Trojan Kin Inspired by <a href="dance.html">Dance</a>		on the Throne of <a href="asteroid.html">Worlorn</a>, one Initiated to the <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a> of Dworkin.		Vlad Petros is unworthy. Crimson Grey is sadly unqualified. Simon		Almustafa must compleat the <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a> or we shall begin anew the		Dark Age I was born to.<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		</font>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
