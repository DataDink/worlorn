She was seated on the lowest tread of a ladder that wasmounted on wheels, so it slid in a track along the wall of tall bookshelves.Maja rolled slightly side to side, humming to herself and reading from thebook, occasionally taking a loud crispy bite from the apple. In the hall outside, Sharra stopped and quoted to herself, "'It's a toughjob, but somebody's got to do it.'" She knocked and entered so fast thatMaja had time only to look up from her page and swallow a last bite of applebefore Sharra stood before her."We must talk," said Sharra."You're wearing your going-away face.""I am returning to Roke," said Sharra. Maja closed her book and placed it on the floor. "Why?""To report. Four turfholders have stolen the slaver from the Cave of the Mara.My tenure as baby sitter is terminated." Maja stood up and began to pace the room. She bit from her apple andchewed it thoughtfully. "Which Archetypes?""Preservation, Secrecy, Transformation, and Protection.""Why?""The Star of Preservation expressed a desire to study the Thrint incontrolled circumstance.""Can Wild Magic Dominate a Dominator?""The Thrint's unconsciousness was Preserved."Maja whistled and turned to Sharra. "How did they know where it was?""I led them to it.""The Decameron's tenth tale has ended? You go to claim Roke Mastery?"Maja blinked and her gaze fell sharply on Sharra. "Wait. They joinedDhruva's avatar here? Four Turfholder Avatars in my father's house?""Six. The Maker of Rules guided Marlee here to deploy them strategically,and your narcoleptic Dark Childe guest, Muriel, awoke briefly to representThe Star of Fire."Before Sharra finished her sentence, Maja stopped pacing to lean her headand empty hand against the bookshelf. She closed her eyes, holding thepose for two breaths, and then pounded the wood with her free hand."Damn! Damn! Damn! A half dozen Turfholders in my Father's House?Where was I when all this happened?"Sharra shrugged. "It was a Secret Crossing-in-the-Mist. Your ignorancewas Preserved.""Yours was not?" Maja accused.Sharra smiled. "I'm special.""Bitch.""Tart.""Wanton.""Eggroll." The women smiled."How long will you be away?""I will be off the Troad calendar.""This trip could take you through your full cycle." Maja said thoughtfully."Immortality."Sharra shrugged. "It could kill me. Dead."Maja piffled, and whispered, "Not bloody likley." She leaned her head againstthe books again. "Everyone leaves me. Father, Mervin, Rune, then mother,now you.""You got Durvail back.""Please stop using her name. She's going into hiding again. I gave her theFlags Morgan left me, so she's out looking for peridot--"Sharra became very still. "You stupid twit.""What?""I told you to keep them safe. You have not resolved the Possession youcast on Derrick, yet you give away Flags to someone who will use themwithin the Radius of your Place of Power? Three overlapping radius?How dumb can you be?""What?""Maja, this city already has two sets of inheritable Flags. Almitra'sson still controls a Radius here. You think for one moment that Dur--mother would not use them to reclaim her tower here?""Maybe not. If the slaver's been taken away, mother can establish aradius in secret somehere else. Besides, Simon's long gone, and myinheritance was consumed by an illithid.""Your mother came back. A chance exists that your inheritance exists."It was Maja's turn to become very still. "What chance? You think thegith children can aid me?""I think you should ask them, girl! Don't just abuse Derrick. You owe thepoor boy. You used him as rudely as your mother used Salt Peter. How do--""How dare you!""Am I wrong?""How dare you!""Am. I. Wrong?""What I did has nothing to do with that. Nothing!""Yes. You have not raped Derrick in Secret. No, you Summoned him from hisbirthworld without permission or choice, forced him to participate in aquest where he has nothing invested and nothing to gain, and when yougot in a tight spot, you used an untested Possession from Morgan la Faye'sprivate spellbook to exchange flesh against his will and thereby costhim his life and Inspiration." The women glared at each other. Sharradropped into a deadly monotone. "I Destroy my enemies, Maj. It takesseconds, leaving only phlogisten and ash. They do not writhe in agonyfor the rest of their lives.""How dare you?""I think you owe Derrick more than an apology. I think you need to studyyour precious prophesy. Maja, you are not as quick as you think. If Iwere you I would be finding ways to beg Derrick's forgiveness, so hemight someday consider restoring my precious inheritance." Maja Barusse's legs collapsed and she fell to the floor, cradling her headin her arms, hands over her ears. Her apple rolled across the rugs. Sharrawalked to stand over Maja without a shred of compassion in her face. "You cannot run from this one. You do not have any coin from Derrick'sbirthworld. I suggest that you get Morgan's Flags back from your motherto use as an opening bid. Else you may be joining Tanri Silverharp whenshe returns to your homeland, outworlder." Sharra turned away and walkedfrom the room, pausing in the doorway. "I hope things work out. I willsee you when I get back." Sharra closed the door, softly, with both hands. She looked up and down theempty hall and put her left hand on a small table. Sharra leaned on thetable, pressing her eyelids with the fingertips and thumb of her otherhand.		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
