Her long orange and red dress			billowed behind her, barely restrained by the white feathered robe. Without			regarding the rows of shelves in the middle of the room, she cut right,			driving straight for a low shelf under the curtained window. Her bare feet			smacked three times on the stone tiles of the library floor before she			stood directly before the bookcase. Maja pointed her right hand at the			books and had put her right index finger on the spine of one before she			lifted her face to the curtains.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The window curtains were drawn. Other than the skylight above, the window			on the long wall was the only light for this room. There were no torch			sconces or candelabras, nor was there a hearth in the library. One could			read by daylight or not at all. Raising her face to the skylight, Maja			noted the black blanket cover, and spun about to face the room, lifting her			right hand from the book to a place  behind her ear.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			She counted five dark figures less than a sword&#146s reach from her, standing			still as death between the first and second rows of shelves. In an eyeblink			Maja closed her upraised hand. A golden longsword appeared, instantly			blossoming in flames as bright as Sunlight. Maja&#146s left hand pulled at a			chain about her neck, trying to tug her pendant free.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja faced the figures, not the brilliance she held behind her, so she was			able to watch one intruder as he cried out and collapsed, saw his outflung			arm turn to dust beneath his cloak and gloves. The man had been over six			feet tall, but even so his empty clothing was a long moment settling the			floor. His cloak floated down like smoke in a still room. The other figures			flinched, all save one, and the tension flared up like her blade, but there			was no other motion in the room.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Please, Barusse," said one of the figures, thinly. The speaker was			shielding his eyes from the glare of the flames, but with the other hand			had lowered his hood to reveal a full head of short grey hair with matching			beard. His eyes were vibrant, piercing, the kind of eyes that remain blue,			brilliant blue, even under a cloudy grey sky. The other figures had turned			entirely away from the light, leaving their hoods on. The spokesman			continued, "Put your Holy relic down. If I came to attack, you would not			remain unmolested after killing my man." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The flames on the sword dispersed with a "thwump" perceived more in the			chest than ears. A wisp of white smoke rose from the tip of the blade and			was gone. The metal continued glowing with red heat as Maja lowered the			weapon. She kept it in hand, but with her body between the visitors and the			blade.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You are uninvited, Vlad Petros." she said. She pulled her left hand from			between her breasts, face growing red.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Incorrect, Barusse. You invited me here, with my entourage, three years			ago to plan for the Five Rings." Petros&#146; eyes glittered as if the sun shone			in them yet.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I rescinded that invitation."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Never in my hearing."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja nodded, and eyes fell to the empty clothing. "He was not a man. What I			did was not a killing. One cannot kill the dead." Her eyes locked again on			Vlad&#146s face, displaying a calmness that contained no regret, no fear, no			anger.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"He was my friend."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja inhaled, and tuned her face to regard the covered curtains, the			skylight. She spoke without looking at him, changing to Wallachian tongue.			Her voice wavered, perhaps from the convoluted honorifics and precise			syntax of that tongue. "He was your . . . a friend. I, I must apologize for			. . . taking from you one who was your friend, my Lord. What may I do to			make things right between us, Lord Drakulya?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The anger on Drakulya&#146s face cleared as if his emotion was washed away.			What remained for an instant was no different than the stillness of a			statue or a corpse. Petros&#146 humanity returned swiftly, a pained look			without anger or aggression. "Maja Barusse, I . . . I can think of nothing			you could do."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Then I will owe you a favor."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Vlad&#146s expression turned stern once more. "It had better be a great favor,			Barusse. He was my . . . my good friend, and a strong leader. Caleb was an			Old One from the time of my grandfather, the first Dai Sensei of the			School of the Bat, a man and a teacher who inspired much loyalty. He will			be missed by all of my people."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Your eulogy speaks to my heart, my Lord. You will discover the strength of			my grief on the day you ask me to pay for it."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Yes, I will," Petros said. He sighed a great sigh while closing his eyes			momentarily. He opened them and looked all about as if awakening in a			strange place. He continued in the Khannish tongue. "May I introduce my			entourage to this household?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You may." Maja relaxed, but maintained her posture, holding the sun blade			drawn in her hand, extended to the floor, behind her body.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"<a href="chrysofar.html">Chrysofar</a> the Red, The Quaestor of Wallachia." Vlad Petros lifted his hand			above the head of a cloaked woman. She raised red-gloved hands to each side			of her hood and pulled the sides back onto her shoulders. The visage was			memorable: white hair falling straight down past shoulders on each side of			her face, flowing past pale pointed ears indicating Pure Eldren, perhaps			Melnibonean, heritage; wolf&#146s eyes of green crystal with a vertical black			stripe on each. A tall red collar showed beneath the black cloak. She			smiled, more of a barring of teeth than an expression of goodwill.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja nodded to the woman.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Akkane, King of the Wind Wolves." Vlad Petros lifted his hand above the			head of the only figure who had not flinched at the Light of the Suns.			Akkane used two pale white hands to lift his hood and drop his cloak to the			ground, revealing a dark-skinned dark-haired Khannish human in buckskin			jacket. His pale grey eyes were striking, demonstrating his blood was not			exclusively Khannish. Akkane looked at Maja and sighed visibly, holding her			sight to his.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja exhaled at the man, who smiled, causing Maja to smile in return. They			held each other&#146s eyes a long moment, and both smiles deepened. "Be			welcome," Maja whispered.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"As always," whispered Akkane, nodding and closing his eyes. Maja&#146s glance			turned to Petros, who nodded and lifted his hand above the head of his			shortest companion.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Vlad paused while she used her long-fingered hands to lift her cloak away			from her face. "Kiera, the thief," said Vlad. Her motion revealed the rich			brown hair and complexion of an elderly Kav Elfar woman. Her grace and			liquid motion reinforced the years that lined her face, darkened her hair.			Her many jewels caught the limited light of the room, reinforcing an			appearance of wealth and refinement. Her utter stillness and quiet spoke			louder than a thousand words. Her longbow and the fletching of three arrows			above the cloak were the only weapons visible in the room aside from Maja&#146s			blade.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja&#146s smile locked in place. She blinked and said, "<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>"			Maja&#146s eyes had never left the woman&#146s face after the moment her name was			spoken aloud. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Kiera nodded. "Thank you. What&#146s mine is yours," she said.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Vlad Petros moved his gloved hand to indicate four chairs around a low			chess table. Maja nodded to him. Petros lifted his other hand to his			people, who glided over to seat themselves. Neither Petros nor Maja took			the fourth seat. Petros stood with his back to the room, arms on the high			back of Chrysofar&#146s chair. They faced the empty chair nearest Maja. On			Maja&#146s left sat Akkane, and on her right sat Kiera. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja crossed to stand directly behind the empty chair. She continued to			hold her body between her unsheathed sword and the intruders, but her wrist			relaxed. She held the blade loosely, flat across the backs of her thighs			rather than tensely extended away from her body. She leaned her left elbow			on the back of the empty chair.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Why are you here?" asked Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I must question Crimson Grey about the Pattern," answered Petros.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Where is your ferret?" asked Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Seeking another family member." parried Petros.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"He must be hard to find." probed Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Yes, she is."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Why not descend to the Bat Cave and ask your Bat Oracle?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Ah, piercing to the heart of the matter in a mere three questions." Petros			looked pleased, but the words were bitter.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You have a lot at stake." Maja deadpanned.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"My Bat Computer is not accessible."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Why?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"A beholder disabled my collection."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Openmouthed, Maja leaned her head forward slightly to regard Petros. When			his expression revealed nothing, her eyes dropped to Akkane, who studiously			resisted looking to her. Chrysofar&#146s smile and keen direct gaze had not			changed since her introduction. Kiera was playing with a tiny lead soldier,			a red pawn from the chessboard, marching it along the arm of her chair. A			white pawn was already on the end of the arm closest to Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You were attacked by a beholder?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Not attacked. She did it only at my most adamant request."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"She? Madam Bird?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Yes."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"So you were where she fled. You gave her sanctuary?" Maja paused, eyes			looking at the floor, seeing nothing in the room. "Then why? Why on earth			would you order her to disable your collection?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"So the Illithids would be unable to use the Bat Computer to answer their			questions."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You are scaring me now."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"About fucking time, Barusse. I have been terrified to immobility since you			were attacked last year. All of us have. Except for Quarma&#146;al, every holder			of Land Law I&#146ve spoken with has been waking up each--day--with one thing			on our minds. Who is next?" Petros expression was cold and frustrated, but			not directed at Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"How much Land Law remains?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Everyone else is fine. You, Madame Bird and myself were the only			casualties when I fled Wallachia last week."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Last week? You took a whole week to let me know?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I made certain no chance existed that I was followed. They don&#146t know			where I am and no one but me and my entourage knows where Bird is hiding			now." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I didn&#146t need to know that." accused Maja.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Yes, you do. She&#146s in Stasis. She&#146ll never waken without someone&#146s help."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Cowardly bitch!" exclaimed Maja. She put her fist over her mouth, but			didn&#146t appear contrite as she regarded Petros. Petros shrugged, but			Chrysofar nodded and Akkane grunted. Kiera had four pawns lined up on each			chair arm, but Maja had yet to see her reach to the chessboard.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Damn! Damn! Damn!" Maja pounded her fist on the chair back. "Where&#146s			Kayleigh?" Petros stared at her. Maja asked, "What?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I came here to ask you."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Me?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Bird said <a href="sharra.html">Decameron</a> came here after the Massacre at			Bird Keep. We figured they had escaped together."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Sharra didn&#146t know."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Where is she?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Sharra or <a href="kayleigh.html">Kayleigh</a>? Sharra&#146s			<a href="dream_990915.html">gone to Roke</a>. She said Rune said the Empress			disappeared as the battle started."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Disappeared?" 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja shrugged. "Sharra said Rune was quite distressed."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros stood like he needed the chair back for support. "The High One&#146s			Harpist didn&#146t know whither Kayleigh escaped to? Not even if the Empress			survived?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja shook her head. She noticed Kiera had paused on her fifth red pawn			only when Kiera resumed its quick march along the chair arm.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Chrysofar piped up, "Are we toast now?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros replied, eyes distant. "Burnt toast, my dear. Charred to ash."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Chrysofar grinned. "Red dragon breathes. All three char and die," she said			with untempered glee. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Complete silence descended in the room. Even to the keenest ears, only			Maja&#146s slow breathing could be heard. Kiera collected both arms of pawns			ambidextrously, swept her hands together, and opened her fingers over the			the chessboard, upsetting the remaining chessmen of both colors.		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
