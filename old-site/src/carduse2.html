Thus the recent Compact seems to have some folkslocked inside their turfs.You are in no danger as long as you stay inside your turfs and/or don'thave to roll dice.Thought Exercise----------------(a) The Compact says the Compact is invoked by someone    beginning an adventure or by someone with a gold card.    [11.1-7.1, 11.1-2.2, 11.7.2](b) The Compact says only brownsheet Nostoi [AKA people who have    escaped from Hissarlik] can weild colored cards.    [11.8.1, 11.8.7, 11.8.11, 11.8.17]	 (c) The Compact says when you're in your turfs you are not on an    adventure.    [8.x.7]a + b =    When an adventure begins in your turf, on demand of any participant or    observer, turfholders MUST use their gold cards to 'wake up' the    Compact in order for the Compact to punish all non-Nostoi for weilding    a colored card. Thus, the Compact says even inside her own turf    a non-Nostoi turfweilder MUST use her own gold card to make the    Compact punish her for being non-Nostoi.a + c =    Non-Nostoi can avoid the fate by forbidding ALL adventures within    your own turf.	<hr width=80%>    Doh."Suicide is painless; It brings on many changes...<hr width=80%>"Don't do that.

I gotta be able to use>m'anvil. Who should I talk to t'make things right [in Damon's>perceptions of right]?"The High One says:"What this Book does now is make sure no riff-raff can go aroun' and messin' up people's turf. I set up the book to keep everyone locked in at home for a bit, to prevent lootin' and vandalizin' until we get the world straightened up.""I'm worried about the people in the book with more than one goldcard. I don't wanna take away all the old rules, that's like throwin' the baby out with the bathwater. I also don't want people to be able to use the book to beat each other up. So what I did was write a chapter that keeps people at home until I get things more safe.""If I throwed out all the olden-days rules, we'd all be limited to only the cards and abilities we have right now [to show the DM] today. I was thinkin' that in order to re-create the old world better, we have to keep the old ways as much as possible, at least until we can stop a while and think it over about what the rule are we wants to keep around and which ones we want to toss out for good.""Now I can't stop you now from Makin' a change if you see that we need one. All I ask is that you figger out what will Make everyone happy before you Make a mistake or Make a questionable difference."<hr width=80%>Date: Sat, 1 May 1999 01:18 (PDT)To: Turfholders"Are things fixed yet?"-Greyson, representative of Dance in Worlorn.		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
