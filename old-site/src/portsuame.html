The Khans donate generous amounts offood, booze and of course guards of the peace to assure a good time is had byall good citizens.<P>The Great Kahn Tigris even warms to Lord Dasher after Vlad Kallion shows upto become Captain Commander of the City. Tigris is seen to toast Lord Dasher,and make some poor but complimentary jokes about commanding cities in hissleep, but not as well and not as long as Lord Dasher.<P>The Dean of the Imperial School, Archmage Alex, is made the Judge of theChange. Alex is to be ombudsman of any and all disagreements that are notresolvable by Vlad Kallion and Lord Dasher (i.e. if Tigris and Kallion andDasher can't come to an agreement, Alex gets to decide). <P>Vlad Kallion appears unsettled when he first meets Archmage Alex, but theDean assures Vlad Kallion that they never met before. Apparently there oncewas a great warrior in the Bat Samurai named Alexander who bears a strikingresemblence to Dean Alex. Vlad Kallion discretely lets the issue drop whenAlex insists for the second time that Kallion must be mistaken, but the cityguard investigation division soon after receives a relevant assignment thatis Dasher/Kallion Eyes Only.<P>Vlad Kallion rapidly earns anew his reputation aquired over the last fiftyyears in Imperial Enseljos and Anarb. Brigand attacks on outlying farms areruthlessly and agressively routed (he admits this is mostly due to the extrainflux of Bat Samurai with no formal dutues). Kallion's repuation as amerciless Justice of the Peace comes to the common men and women. Portcivillians rapidly decide that Kallion's Night Court is not a place for thosewith uncertain claims.<P>City Guards are more busy for perhaps a month. That is about how long ittakes cutpurses to learn night is not any better than day when a Vlad makesthe watch lists. Kallion is circumspect to assign only the standard 90%Khannish/10% other guard squads to make it known that it is his leadership,and not his School, which makes the city safer.<P>Lady Moeru opens a flower shoppe: The Rose Petal, with nightly hours and teaservice, too. The genteel flock to it with relish in order to be seen there.Those with epicurian tastes in fauna resolve ouyt loud to return when theseedlings Moeru brought from her previous gardens bloom. Mages who need morerare vegetation can always find a clue, if not a bulb, in Moeru'sestablishment. Night life tends to gravitate about visits to The Rose Petal'first part of the night,' 'the witching hour,' or 'the dawn service.' Noone ever comments on the length of Moeru's teeth, or asks her to one's ownparlor during the daylight. <P>The Free Port Suame is a more happy city than most have been in decades. TheEmperor's wisdom is toasted many times in Kallion's first month.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
