Uncharacteristically, <a href="petros.html">Vlad Petros</a> is			walking swiftly to keep up with an elfar; normally companions of the prince stride			to match his pace. Both men wear black, from boot to gloves, with only their heads			exposed. Tanri thinks she has seen this elfar companion before, perhaps in a dream.			His black is the dress uniform of a <a href="n_darkangel.html">Dark Angel</a>.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja&#146;s butler Anton appears inside the front door. He is a dark haired Khansman,			perhaps thirty. Perhaps he was always there, but Vlad and his companion stop and spin,			making flat knives of their hands and freezing in battle stances, as if they both were			surprised to see Anton appear. At this time the Dark Angel notes Tanri&#146;s presence. 			The Wallachians relax and adjust their formal clothing. Their eyes meet. The Dark Angel			says, "Alfred," and they share a smile.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Oblivious, with back to the Wallachians, Anton places both hands on the heavy brass			knockers. He waits to open the twin doors until the sound of a knock fills the entrance			hall and fades completely. The butler Anton opens both doors and regards the visitor. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The visitor is human, tall and thin and ancient. He must be over forty, perhaps fifty,			or more. His hair is cropped military short, almost as short as Petros&#146;, and			is peppered with as much grey. The men would be age-mates. The newcomer wears the black			and grey uniform of the occupying armies, the officer-priests of the Deathgod. He			displays many colorful insignias and awards on the left breast of his jacket.			He is alone.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Grand Moff Tarkin to see the singer."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Yes sir," says Anton. "The singer?" 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Vlad Petros steps forward, his Dark Angel working hard to stay between the Prince			and the Grand Moff without blocking the view of either. "Anton, we will guide the			Grand Moff to the sitting room if you will locate <a href="maja.html">Lady Barusse</a>."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Anton does not hesitate. "Yes, my Prince." Anton walks to the stair and ascends,			passing Tanri with a respectful nod and smile. None of the men below glance upwards.			<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"What singer are you referring to?" asks Petros.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"A good day to you, Lord Drakulya. How is the state of Wallachia on this fine morning?"			Tarkin&#146;s booming false cheer fills the room.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"We have taken it back from the occupying force, of course. It appears Illithids are			as squeamish about the <a href="morganti.html">Real Death</a> as are your priests			of <a href="yama.html">Yama</a>." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The top of the steps is far enough away, out of range, so that Tanri&#146;s ears			ring, but she is not deafened or slain by hearing the evil name. Vlad Drakulya spits			out a fly from his mouth as he says the god&#146;s name, but otherwise appears unbothered.			The Death Priest Tarkin is of course not affected by an Unholy Word from his own deity.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			However, Petros&#146; Dark Angel blinks rapidly and sways on his feet and holds out			his arms slightly, as if dizzy from a great blow to the head. The Dark Angel glares			at his lord, a glare that Tanri recognizes instantly. This is the Dark Angel that			she disarmed and captured! (<i>Alone? Was there another helper or was that a dream?</i>)			The assassin now looks even more angry than when Tanri held him helpless			in that grassy field. Vlad Petros dismisses his Dark Angel with a second gesture after			the first produces only heightened irritation.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The Grand Moff smiles. "Threats, and displays of power, so early in the morning?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Vlad Petros shrugs. "You must not have heard news of your forces deployed to occupy			Wallachia. Do not wait for their souls to appear in the <a href="dryland.html">Dry			Land</a>, Grand Moff. It is no longer possible. Maarter Phaal was decades unfed.			Your soldiers no longer participate in the <a href="mortalcoil.html">Mortal Coil</a>."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Tarkin regards Petros in silence. He says, "You are beyond evil." Petros bows.			Tarkin continues, "How did the Illithids deploy effectively against Wallachian			Land Law?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I should tell you their strategy?" Vlad cups an elbow in his palm, and places the			other hand under his chin, gazing towards the ceiling, seeing Tanri for the first			time. After meeting her eyes, Petros ignores Tanri entirely. "I do believe that			no chance exists."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You can satisfy my curiosity." Tarkin says jovially. "For old times&#146; sake."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros smiles a tight smile. "For old times&#146; sake? Very well then. Let us finish			with old loyalties now." Tarkin appears mildly confused. "The monsters had inspired			help." says Petros. Tarkin raises both eyebrows. Petros continues. "Family help."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"A Kin of Troy aiding Illithids against the family?" Tarkin is incredulous.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"It is not the first time. However, for this woman, it was her first and last time."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"A woman? You fed her to the morganti too?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"I may be impatient and direct, but I am not stupid. No Kin will come to Wallachia			to punish me for using Maarter Phaal on family. A Truthsay verified my cousin was			aiding Illithids against Imperial Wallachia, against my city and holdings at Tirgoviste,			as well as aiding her to satisfy a grudge against me personally. She is now disabled,			incarcerated and undergoing further interrogations."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Interrogations? Is the Necrodemian Morganti Interdict against rape still active?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Why are you here, Tarkin?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Why are you here, Petros?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Maja and <a href="sharra.html">Sharra</a> invited the other <a href="greatworks.html"><i>Go Rin No Sho</i></a>			bearers here to discuss how we will punish you personally. I wanted to <b>Transform</b>			you into something petty and small and kind of heart, but the others wanted a change.			Sharra of course wants you <b>Destroyed</b>. <a href="abelard.html">Abelard</a> wanted			to <b>Protect</b> you in a permanent retirement community, but the honored Lord Heron			insists that you should be <b>Unmade</b>, with all memories of you lost even to your god."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"How dare you!"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"We are <i>not</i> joking!" The men stand too close. Petros steps closer still, chest to			chest with Tarkin. "You act against the Empire you vowed to uphold, Grand Moff!			You are a traitor."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Tarkin smiles as if waiting for this moment. "The Armies of Death and the Grey			Lord act under the authority of Necrodemus I, following orders from his appointed			sovereign, Machiavelli of Florence. You of all people cannot reproach me, Lord			Drakulya. Your grandfather Vlad Tepes held Necrodemus himself accountable			when the Emperor failed to uphold his own laws. We are doing the same for his			absent heir."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Necrodemus I is dead. You are a traitor to his heir."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"The heir has forsaken our Empire, We cannot allow one man&#146;s absence to damage the			legacy of Necrodemus. Let the High One come forth and accuse us of treason."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The men stand silent.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"As Prince of Wallachia, I am within my rights to accuse in his stead."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Rights! What are you going to do Petros? Ask a Truthsay who is correct?" Tarkin			laughs, a short bark that echoes throughout the tiled hall. Petros&#146; whisper			is almost lost in the echoes.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"You will remove the Death Star back to its berth in Terra Mortae, or you shall see			what I will do, Tarkin. <i>You will retreat in your moment of triumph!</i> If the next			<a href="redlight.html">Red Light</a> casts a shadow of your Death Star anywhere			but Terra Mortae, no one, not me, not the High One, not even your god, will know			you ever existed."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Tarkin has nothing for Petros but the rage in his eyes. He turns abruptly and opens the			doors, departs.		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros stands where he was. His gloved fists clench and unclench. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja comes up behind Tanri, smiles and descends to stand near Vlad Petros. "You			frightened off my guest? Shame on you! Was it really the Grand Moff? I so much			wanted to see him." Vlad can nod, but apparently not speak. Even from this distance,			Tanri can see Petros shivering, as if cold. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja steps to him and puts her hands on his shoulders. She starts to rub with stiff			fingers, digging them into his leathers. "I didn&#146;t even know you were here.			Wallachia is retaken? Of course it is. Does Sharra know?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"No one knows I&#146;m here" Petros says, "We&#146;ve not been here an hour. Dokken			and I were on our way to Junior&#146;s kitchen when Tarkin paid a call. He says			he&#146;s withdrawing the Death Star immediately." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja looks up stairs at Tanri, and smiles. Vlad Petros follows her glance, but he			is not smiling. "Is that the singer?"		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja nods and says, "Haven&#146;t you met Tanri? Tanri Silverharp sang a special			song for the Grand Moff while you were away. From what Sharra says we may have			empowered it sufficiently to force Tarkin to leave only on its merits."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"A song did all that? Then I am pleased to meet you Tanri," calls the Prince of Wallachia.			"I invite you to sing for me officially some time."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<font color=885500>			 "It would be my honor, Lord Drakulya," responds Tanri, with a courtly bow.  			"Please forgive me for eavesdropping on your conversation," she continues, 			starting down the stairs. "As the visitor named me when he entered, I assumed 			the conversation would involve me. I appear to have been wrong. Please 			name the level of secrecy you wish for that conversation, and I will hold 			to it."			</font>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Pray do not keep secrets on my account." Petros smiles an evil smile, displaying no teeth. "Perhaps the lich feels differently, but I have nothing to fear if our little chat comes to light." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Despite the words, Petros suddenly appears gravely concerned, extends a gloved hand towards Tanri. "However, as the Grand Moff came to speak with "the singer" and not the Prince of Wallachia, it is for me to apologize and offer reparation. I hope you are not insulted. How may I make amends?" 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"In my anger I thoughtlessly interrupted what maybe your only opportunity to deal with the Necrodemian Grand Moff. I know there are citizens all over the empire who would die to see Governor Tarkin."  Vlad Petros's face is placid, but a tight smile curves his lips. "We may never learn Tarkin's purpose for visiting, for a chance exists that now that the lich will never remember his intentions at all."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<font color=885500>			 Tanri reaches the bottom of the stairs, and stands facing him, calm and poised. 			Then she breaks into a grin. "[Then] I should thank you, for inadvertently turning 			his attention away from me. I'm not sure I want to know what that gentleman 			wanted with me, or how much he knows about what I have done."  			</font>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros bows his head, clicking the heels of his boots together. His icy blue eyes meet Tanri's' with surprising force. "None-the-less, I wronged you, to your good fortune or no." 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja softly touches the small of Tanri's back with her finger, saying "Tanri Silverharp does not dismiss your offer to make amends, Lord Drakulya. She will honor your honor when it is appropriate." Petros holds Tanri's gaze a moment, then bows his head, once to Tanri, then again to Maja, who blinks with surprise. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<font color=885500>			Tanri turns to Maja. "I don't know if Anton told you, but he originally asked 			for "the singer" when he arrived."			</font>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja nods. "I admit surprise to see that the Moff had not accosted you, since he came here with that intent." She turns to Petros. "What did you say that would make a politician leave rudely without seeing his hostess? I didn't think Tanri's song would leave conscious resentment or anger."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<font color=885500>			 Tanri's features cloud a bit. "And Maja, I fear you give me too much credit. My 			spell was only to prevent him from opposing your church. You said you did not 			care who walked the streets in this city, so I did not weave his departure, 			specifically. If he finds himself powerless to act, and would not stay for any 			other reason, then he will leave. If he takes Lord Drakulya at all seriously," a 			nod to the man next to her, "then he will leave quickly. But my magic will not 			impel him on its own. I did not know that you wanted that. I'm sorry."			</font>		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja forces a self conscious laugh, and looks sideways at Petros. "Then we were			unfortunately unclear in our haste. We wove a departure into your song. Sharra and I cast enchantments to carry on your pervasive voice and music." Maja's face  grows pink, but she seems to be more worried about Petros' reaction than Tanri's. 		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			"Within my radius, the words of your song carried my Water powers to Remove the Death Star from Port Suame, and within my radius I enabled Sharra to Destroy Tarkin's morale with the fires of your convictions."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Petros smiles briefly at Maja, here and gone, before he turns impassively to Tanri. "I was so certain that I was lying to Tarkin."		<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Maja glances back and forth between her guests. Petros responds only by offering  upturned eyebrows towards Tanri.			<P>			<font size=-2>991213 mgg &amp; ww</font><br>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">	<a href="invinceable.html"><i>next chapter</i></a>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
