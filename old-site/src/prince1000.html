Ectomorphic (thinner fingers and limbs rather	than thicker). His affinity is for white robes and a floppy wide	brimmed white hat, although he wears white gi/loose pirate shirts	and loose pants. Llyr wears white or occasionally solid colored	clothing. Llyr never wears a colored belt of martial arts rank.	He has been seen in Watersea, even on its throne, wearing blue	Chambray shirts and Levis 501 button fly jeans with 7-button Bald	Mountain moccasins. He wears jewelry only when it is an emerald,	or a lemniscate, or is magically functional, or is a gift from a	friend.</blockquote><br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"><b>the prince who was 1000</b> started as a simulacrum of dworkin's flesh.the prince was a blood-law road encounter <i>made whole</i> by the maker,champion dwarfgod, so troy could receive champion's "rent" on kaldamaaren.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">troy-ounces-made-whole was imprisoned by the dragon Frost during anapparently-failed <i>find familiar</i> attempt, and was rescued yearslater. after triggering a morganti trap on cinnamon (or was that spice?),the prince who was 1000 wrested control of watersea from<a href="llewellyn.html">llewellyn ap-owen</a>and drew on its powers, seeking to Remove the soul of his beloved from herwu-hsin. the prince now travels under the name dylan llyr.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475"><h3>tanngrisnir on the prince who was 1000</h3>Unlike The Prince Who Was 1000, Troy Made Whole by Champion, I will notstrive for easy power, fail, and sit in reflection for three generationsineffectively striving to recover morganti'd loved ones.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475"><h3>Morgan la Faye on Dylan Llyr</h3><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"I think Troy-Ounces-Made-Whole has found himself another unattainable love."announces Morgan, pausing to concentrate on setting down her empty cup andsaucer between her chair and the hearth. The spoon rattles in the cup allthe way down, but Eressea says nothing, knowing it's not precisely a physicalailment. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The left sleeve of Morgan's outer sweater catches on a wooden sliver, barelyjutting from the foot of the chair. Eressea sees it, but before she can act,Morgan pulls back, unravelling a huge loop of yellow yarn, almost the colorof her hair. Morgan leans back forward and uses both hands to unhook andfree the loop. She tucks the loop of yarn into her sleeve before she dropsback in her chair, sighing slightly. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Morgan continues speaking as if without a pause. "He's as devoted toMelisse as he first was to Fr--you met her, didn't you? Llyr's sentientice dragon? Up north just before she imprisoned him for so long? Nevercontent with a normal familiar! And then he was obsessed with bringingCinnamon back. For years he spurned Spice, never once thinking that her_twin_ was dead! _She_ needed _him_, more than ever before in her life!Where does Llyr go put in pursuit of another impossible woman." <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Morgan shakes her head. "I pity Melisse. Such a loss for one so young.Stolen innocence, just like Silverfox. Even in death she's still notcontrolling her path. And they say Gwenhyvar's tale is the saddest storyever told. I suppose Llyr wouldn't be so damn heroic without a tragic flaw."<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Lying deep in her stuffed armchair, Morgan steeples her fingers and peersthrough them at Eressea, adding, "I'm not ashamed to say Llyr scares thehell out of me. No Kin should be able to do the things he's done.  'ThePrince who was 1000' indeed... A thousand secrets. He's a wild magic magnet.Worse than Waldann. You have no idea... I asked him for the statue, but... "Morgan immerses herself again in her fragmented thoughts. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Both women regard the dying embers in the hearth of Dolbadarn. It holdsa summer fire, overly warm despite the wee morning hour, but guestsalways come first in Eressea's Dolbadarn. None of the other guestschoose this room. It is the heat of Morgan's reputation as much asthe hearth. Presently Morgan frowns and takes out her silver comb,the one she thinks Cori gave her. She begins combing out her hair,as she does every time she discerns the extent of her stolen Dreams.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"I think that if Cori ever devours the rest of me, by Dira's Tits, ifANYTHING takes one of us beyond your abilities, cousin, it's my wish,I want you to go straight to Llyr." Before Eressea can respond, Morgansits bolt upright.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"I got it, of course!" Morgan smiles, her gaze intent on Eressea, hercomb brandished like a drumstick beating the rhythm of her words. "Ibet you, if anyone does, Llyr knows where the Half Elven One is. Probablyhiding Oimota in Llyr's Voided wild magic, working on some cleversequel to Hissarlik. I wonder what could make him spill his guts?"<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Quickly Eressea sees the enthusiasm leave Morgan's eyes. In moments herattention returns to her combing. Presently her arms slow and herbreathing grows regular. Minutes pass into hours. The flames in thefireplace die out, but the logs still glow. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Eressea is just about to be pleased that Morgan finally put her mindto sleep, but the Pillars of the Dawn shine in through the easternwindow and the morning doves cry out. Morgan la Faye pushes herselfup from her chair and limps to the window, where she looks to thepink clouds, drops her gaze to the silver waves of the Sea of Chaos,and then shivers.</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
