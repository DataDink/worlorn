Many Swan felt 'a disturbance in the force" and common wisdomindicates between five and six hands of Swan Elfar immediately heard theCall of Avranaith. The specific Wisdom of their calls was intentionallywithheld from their marks.It is common wisdom passed on by the Swan that Castle Erorn in SwanTerritory is the lair of two Morganti weapon bearers, the Bounty HunterMichael Donn and his teyn the Coven Angel Padraig [see also third answer,below].Ryandall's Quaal Mark has absolutely no wisdom to pass on about MorgantiWeapons. Unlike Swan Elfar, Quaal Elfar deliberately hold the mark asidewhen horrors are encountered, to prevent bad wisdom from taintingancestors. The practise of setting aside the Wisdom of the Quaal is knownwell to the mark, but horrible wisdom itself is never passed on by QuaalElfar.&gt; weapons delivering the real deathThe Quaal Mark passes on the wisdom that an ArchDruid of the Trees, theFounder of Orion's Woods, wielded a black sword of the Real Death. It isnot known if the longsword was wengen steel or black mithril, but it isknown the blade was not part of Morganna's infamy. The name of Orion'sblasphemy is not part of the Wisdom of the Quaal Mark, but it is a lessonto be passed on that Orion was denied circle rebirth by the Phoenix becausehe carried such a weapon willingly. A branch of Quaal theology is concernedabout the Phoenix preventing the Motherlode from allowing a Master Druid tobe born again.&gt; and weapons made of living woodBoth marks pass on common wisdom that there are many weapons of livingwood, sufficient to indicate creation and enchantment of such items is notthe exclusive realm of druids. Wisdom passed on by both marks says livingwood is not limited to wood from the Tree of Life or the Tree of Knowledge,although magical value departs wood from these trees when it is notsustained as living wood. Wisdom passed on by the Lios Marks suggests initiation to most covencircles demands a creature to create his or her own wooden knife of livingwood, called a thammay. Swan Mark confirms this for the Shando and Wengencircles, and Quaal Mark knows this is true of of Sacremento Circle. Wisdomindicates creating a coven thammay requires roughly a second level druidspell.&gt; being most interested in intersections of the three.Swan and Quaal Mark wisdom suggests that the "only" intersection ofMorganti, Real Death, and living wood was Kankyo, the Shando arrow. TheSwan Mark hints at another weapon without any specifics, but there is nosuch wisdom in the Quaal Mark, despite common wisdom regarding Kannon as amember of Sacremento Coven around the time of Orion's rise to Archdruid.Padraig, the wielder of Kankyo, was kav elfar raised outside the holdfast,who joined the Coven of Fleeter. He ruthlessly ascended to  Mastery of theNinth Circle in less than a hand of years. Not being circle born or even deepwoods, Padraig stole and abused all theCircle knowledge he could obtain for his own powers and benefit, includinglearning the secret of Shando arrows without pledging to that circle. When Padraig was exposed to the Logrus, the power in his bow and arrowsbecame sustained, so Padraig was able to use them for paid assassinationswithout fearing them to become unclean in the Motherlode's eyes. When oneof Padraig's eleven arrows was selected to be a Morganti Weapon, Kanyo wasnamed. No Swan wisdom is passed about Padraig after the thirteenth year ofNecrodemus, when the Coven Angel slew a Dark Angel brother (along with thespirit possessing him).		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
