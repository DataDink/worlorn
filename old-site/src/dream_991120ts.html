Sharra brought			back Derrick's sleeping form and had just withdrawn			with it and Maja into the Womb Room, an <a href="abelard.html">Abelard Sanctuary</a>,			when Muriel, the Dark Child houseguest from <a href="flambeau.html">Flambeau</a>,			came in and chatted them up. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			It came to pass that Muriel said the name of the <a href="chrysofar.html">Dust Queen			of Winds</a>, which summoned DUST in the WIND into the Womb Room. surely as if			it was an invited vampire.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			No chance existed that Maja could survive DUST while trapped in the Womb Room.			Maja's last act was to set down the cosmic dice for Sharra and Derrick. A			chance existed that Sharra could live unscathed through DUST due to Roke Training.			With Maja's help, Sharra survived. A chance existed that <i>For Derrick</i> could			interpose himself between the DUST effect and the Sleeping Derrick. Derrick			Survived. <i>For Derric</i>k did not. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Muriel was apparently entirely unaffected by DUST in the WIND. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The (ex-)Phoenix (<a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a>) immediately ordered			his servant Muriel give rebirth			to Maja, another deity's minion who Threnody's minion had slain. Muriel was			ordered to deliver four flags (Place of Power chocolates, coincidentally a power			granted by the Phoenix) to the Highest Priestess of Brilliance, because Maja			had been <b>Dusted</b> in her father's legacy Place of Power and therefore			lost her inheritance until she inherited the other POP from her mother. 		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			When she sees the Flags as chocolates, Tanri is suddenly overwhelmed by a sense			of <a href="dream_990621.html">deja vu</a>. How Odd&#151deja vu during supernatural prescience? Anyway...		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The Greater Princess of Evil Drow Devils immediately offered many gifts to the			Goddess of Sunlight to appease Her for the damage done by an evil drow devil.			Maja was reborn. In Port Suame instead of the Dung Pits. Maja was reborn with			no constitution point loss, without losing reincarnations. Maja was given the			chance to resume a Place of Power before her inheritance. Maja is immune to			DUST in the WIND.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Rebuking Muriel, her sword no longer talks, but rather instead now the sword			burns piles of Dust with the <b>Fires of Life</b>, causing Dust piles to be reborn			in flame as the human beings they used to be. If this is punishment, Maja			thinks she wants to be punished by the god of Rebirth.... <i>not really. A joke,			she insists. A joke!</i>		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Lord Morin was disturbed that Muriel and Threnody were unmoved by <i>For Derrick</i>'s			sacrifice enough to give rebirth to the fallen Githzerai. However, Morin persisted			and Muriel eventually gave rebirth to For Derrick.		<P><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Sharra advised Maja to save the chocolate Flags of Power until she could			assimilate them in a greater or enhanced manner of some kind, something about			accumulating more power before Maja locked her powers in place, but Maja ate			all four chocolate "Flags" right away and restored her Place of Power status			quo nearly as fast as she could, because			<a href="tanrisong01.html">the army of death was attacking</a>.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
