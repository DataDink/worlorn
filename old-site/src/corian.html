McKennit)<br>Date: Thu, 30 Mar 95 18:02:05 PST</h3>	<blockquote><font size="-1"><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Back at his room, Corian invites Chrysofar in. He smiles and meets your 	eye when you think what he&#146;s thinking, but he shakes his head sidaways once. 	You decide to go in, but after a glance, only <i>after</i> Corian lights a lamp...<br>	<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	The room is knee-deep with all kinds of nonsense: books and nooks and wierd 	water clocks tossed on the shelves sideways to make room for more mechanical	oddities. He picks up something once vegetable from a chair and puts it on 	another, but all of it falls to the floor a moment after he turns his back. He 	chuckles from the wet-bar and fills two glasses with something smelling of 	apples or a close substitute. There&#146;s a movement coming from underneath 	a pile until Cori says &#147;shush, Marian.&#148; Corian notices your alarm, and shrugs 	his shoulders. &#147;she&#146;s only this big,&#148; he says, holding his palms about six 	inches apart. &#147;I haven&#146;t been able to get her to come out for maybe a week. 	Must be finding her own way fine enough.&#148; Chrys think about this, and notes	that he&#146;s collected it all within in one of Diapar Keep&#146;s &#145;visitor&#146; rooms...<br>	<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">	As you both find seats to settle in among the clutter, he clears his throat. 	Handing over Chrysofar one of the drinks, Corian tells a story.</font></blockquote>	<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Back there by the Troy painting I knew you was hurting out of missing someone real bad, but I thought you was Morgan, see, &#146;cuz she lost track of our son about fifty years ago. Huh. haven&#146;t seen her for near that much myself, but I know how she feels about him, since she even told me once.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Actually, I never met my boy at all, seein that Morgan never had the mindto tell me that she was goina be makin a child outa the times we loved...After we weren&#146;t <i>together</i> no more, I hadda leave town, out of self-preserving,you know. I went back the next summer, though, and found she wasn&#146;t livin where she used to; she went somewhere to raise the boy.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;That there was a real good time, the summer when we met. I remember first seein Morgan all angry at something, from across the night market. Some wizard or other got hisself in a bind and was trying to short Morgan outa something, and she wasn&#146;t havin nothin to do with it. She was getting all bent up, and this guy was getting calmer and calmer, but with this glow in each eye, like some people get right befores they kill something once and for all or they die trying to stay alive from it. I step up between them both and say &#145;nows old Cori&#146;s here there&#146;s no need for killing and thank you very much, but what&#146;s the difficulty?&#146;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;She stands tall and lays at me full bore with them goddess eyes, her haughty &#145;I'm Kin of Troy and who-the-hell-are-you&#146; look, and she asks me straight away whether I have a set of white owl feathers so she won&#146;t have to <i>Change</i> this wizard or me and pluck us naked. The whole festival-night market seemed to hush, still as a sleeping lion or a beach between waves.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Recon that if I din&#146;t have the good fortune of havin the owl as my totem, I mighta got born again that day.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;I stared back straight into her eyes while I pulled a white feather from my prayer-bag and I reached out and tickled her nose with it until she blinked. &#145;You wann it Wen-gen or Shan-do?&#146; I drawl real slow, and even Morgan la Faye couldn&#146;t help but smile. She took my arm to move away, but turned quick and the wizard fellow was already holding out silver coin back to her. I heard someone hoot, and the market stopped holdin its breathand everythin got loud again.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;By now I figgered she was deepwoods, but I couldna place her by coven. Sheweren&#146;t no Wengen with hair like yours; and she had too much city-stance tobe Shando, and no Karli would be payin by coin, even if it was Garrik&#146;s silver. I figured she was a half-breed like me, born to some coven but notenough lep to be invited into the circle. When she put the silver into her pouch I asked &#145;hey where you all be from?&#146; and I&#146;ll always remember what she said back to me. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147; &#145;I&#146;m from nowhen you&#146;ll ever be, deepwoods.&#146; Man, she was looking in my face then, and I never before seen so much pain in someone standing up. I was gonna say something kind back at her, but then she turned face away, and grabbed my arm tighter than she meant, like she was pulling <i>me</i> back from a cliff of danger. &#145;How much those feathers going to cost, Wengen?&#146; she says, and I remember that, too, &#146;cuz she never before and rarely after said nothing at me while lookin away. &#147;So I said, &#145;how about an hour of your time spent with some Wengen never been nowhen?&#147;<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;She whistled low like a trader might if you were offerin too much for his friend&#146;s horse. &#145;I ain&#146;t never paid s&#146;much for <i>any</i> thin in my nat-ur-al life!&#146; she said, voice singin up and down like she was full-circle Wengen, kinda funnin with my way of talkin, and it was maybe a week or two before I knew her enough to say she wasn&#146;t really joking.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">We danced that night, under a half moon. It was one of those wild city dances,a torchlight festival going on all over that town, the kind that goes with music that&#146;s good and fun to dance depite bein wrote by a man who never danced a deepwoods circle all his life. I took her in my arms and spun her fast, figuring she&#146;d get dizzy enough to ask old Corian when was enough, but she laughed and spun me back, up past dawn, always finding another place she knew after they&#146;d put out the fire in the old pub.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;We spent a time in the market, too, with all the vendors yellin at me to buy her a flower or a dress or something, but all I had could afford was a tiny silver clip for her hair. She got real quiet when I bought it, and I was afraid she&#146;d not let me put it on her, but she made me do it myself. I see that design sometimes on other women, and I can remember how it felt on the back of her head as we close-danced, and how it caught the fire when I&#146;d spin her in front of me. Damn few times I spent out awake all night always moving when no one was after me, but then again, I kinda guess I couldn&#146;t say there wasn&#146;t any chasing going on that night.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"Some time between the fire in her eyes and when she put her hand between mine to watch the sunrise come up she must of decided that old Corian was worth her hour. We danced and drank and even sang our way through quite a few festval halls. I &#146;s pect we went through just about all the drinking-dancin-fighting places they had open that night, cuz there was a whole bunch of stories we heard about ourselves, come to be sung later that summer and into the fall. The poet Barion, Richelieu&#146;s son, says he followed us around that night, and itmade him write out this long song what you can still hear wedding mights along that part of the world. I suppose he coulda been there. I didn&#146;t notice him or anyone else beside Morgan. I didn&#146;t never fall in love before that night we danced, and I guess she didn&#146;t neither.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Never did find out what she wanted my feathers for, but my white-winged friends always had a kind word for Morgan, so I never asked.&#148;</td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=75><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=right height=25 width=475><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=75><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=right height=25 width=475><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=left height=25 width=75><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=right height=25 width=475><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=left height=25 width=75><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=right height=25 width=475><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td>	<td valign=top align=left height=25 width=75><br></td>	<td valign=top align=center height=25 width=25><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
