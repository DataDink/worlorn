An outsider would find them priceless treasures, many agreedy heart would be tempted, but to the Dwarfgod, they're just trinketswith little use to him, mostly just magic stuff he wouldn't even know what todo with.<P>"I know I left the blasted things 'round here somewheres..."<P>At last, in a back corner of the room he finds the elaborately workedplatinum box. "THERE it is!" he says with some satisfaction as he blows thedust off it. "Hmmm, needs polishin' " <P>He goes back to his room with the box, where he opens it cautiously; withmovements as judicious as the heavy stone fingers can manage. It is as if heexpects some monster to spring from it, in fact he would have been more atease with a nice viscous trap to confront. Open at last, the box revealsnothing more dangerous than a stack of painted cards.<P>He rapidly sorts through them until he finds one near the bottom. He frowns,not really sure about using the powerful magic. He tries holding it lots ofdifferent angles and ranges, at last settling on holding the card at armslength and eye level as he stands uncomfortalby in front of it.<P>"Uh... er, I mean.... uh Wedge? You there?" Then under his breath, "Blast,Threndy said this'd work..."<P>Louder his gravelly voice calls, "Uh, Wedge! I dreamed of ya! An' I sawwhere's ya took Threndy. I think maybe you better take me there too. I gotsumpthin' for the Deathgod." He quickly glances at the golden bowl. "An' Ithink Threndy needs some help. Threndy's been a pal, 'n I wanna help th'elf." At last he shrugs and puts the card back into box with the others.<P>He picks up the golden bowl and turns it slowly round in his hands admiringthe nifty design he put aournd the inside of the rim. For a moment a frown orscowl clouds his granite features, he still doesn't understand why his elvenscribe turned white as ghost when he saw that nifty design, but in a momentthe breif dismay has fled and he is once again fascinated by the bowl'selaborate engraved pattern.<P><font size=4><b>From TroyOunces@aol.com Sat Jun 3 10:36:46 1995<br>Subject: lumbering towards death</b></font><P>Wedge assists Damon, guiding his Holy Entourage to the Ziggurat known asIroncastle.<P>It is much different travel than with <a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a>.The entourage of dwarves isboisterous, funloving, and enjoy making noises at all hours of the day ornight. The men and women of the Dwarven party are with life as children witha new toy. They are a young race, and this second generation remains moreengrossed with the lust of living their lives fully than Threnody appeared inhis quiet brooding.<P>There are times <a href="wedge.html">Wedge</a> forgets the destination asthe days go by. The Dwarvesare as a conucopia of medicine for the wounded soul. He takes page upon pageof notes for drinking, fornicating, and fighting songs. Three weeks pass andthere is only one sobering event on the adventure.<P>Wedge and Damon learn an important thing; dwarven clerics are NOT turned toblood with Threnody's <a href="redlight.html">Red Light</a>. <P>Barshette, the Priestess who makes this discovery alternately laughs and crysfor three days after she let herself forget what time it was while birdwatching a rare species of eagle. The party is hard pressed to keep up thehappiness in the face of Barshette's derangement, but meets the challengeadmirably. There is singing at night and on the marches, and if the volumeincreases sometimes to cover her wails, no one comments. <P>Damon for three nights cradles her to sleep, crooning lullabies and quietingher moans with kisses like rain, so the others may rest. She holds himtightly, bruising his flesh, but the god Makes not to notice. Wedge takesnotes for another sort of song and story, and feels ashamed.<P>Barshette recovers her spirits the fourth daybreak. That evening the otherholy ones end all pretense and do not bless their tents or make sure the campis established by 6PM. The nervous laughter is over by 6:02PM. <P>The party makes excellent time after this, covering twice the ground asexpected by travelling for 14-18 hour days. The Dwarven party camps outsideIroncastle on Summer Begins of the Year 85 Necrodemus. They agree to remainwith Wedge outside forever, until Damon is done with his tete-a-tete withdeath.<P><font size=4><b>From DamonEtrnl@aol.com Sat Jun 3 19:57:53 1995<br>Subject: Re: lumbering towards death</b></font><P>Damon enters the throne room with a cautious look to left, then right.Spotting <a href="roland.html">Roland</a> at Yama's introductionhe squints at the man for a long moment, then grunts. "Well met, Roland..."<P>Finally, his gaze returns to the <a href="deathgod.html">Deathgod</a>."H'llo Deathgod. It's been a longtime. I ain't much fer Makin' speeches. I let muh work speak fer me," as hepulls the large golden bowl out of his pack. "I made this fer ya. On accounta ya having been kilt 'n all, an' o'course mostly cuz I heard ya was aliveagin." He hands the Deathgod the simple, shallow bowl, with the odd designaround the inner lip.<P>"Oh yeah, 'n also cuz ya was nice 'n let me go on about things last time Isaw ya, even though ya took everyone else off ta the Paths. I didn't reallyknow what a Deathgod might need, but I figures even if'n ya don't need thishere bowl, it'd go nice on some altar somewheres."<P>As Yama examines the bowl, he realizes that the elaborate design is, in fact,an elaborate script. A fact which Damon seems to be oblivious of.Nevertheless, it reads:<pre>"I wage not any fued with Death  For changes wrought on form and face;  No lower life that earth's embraceMay breed with him can fright my faithEternal process moving on, From state to state the spirit walks; And these are but the shattered stalks,Or ruined chrysalis of one.Nor blame I Death, because he bare The use of virtue out of earth; I know transplanted human worthWill bloom to profit, otherwhere.For this alone on Death I wreak The wrath that garners in my heart: He put our lives so far apartWe cannot hear each other speak."</pre></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
