The grey sky glows in all places equally. Trees border her world, a leafy horizon		at ten miles in all directions, but between <i>For-Tanri</i> and the trees, there is only snow and 		the workmen below.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A wooden stick has been driven into the ground at her side. It sticks up six inches above the 		snow, perhaps two feet in total length, top nearly at eye level. From its tip, pieces of brown 		twine have been strung, leading off, arrow straight in eight directions. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		More branches support the string every fifteen paces. A bow shot away, <i>For-Tanri</i> sees 		cross-strings, concentric circles such that no area within a hundred yards is more than fifteen 		paces from a post. The eight radial strings continue to perhaps a thousand yards, with too 		many circle strings to count. <i>For-Tanri</i> stands at the center, as if a spider at home.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		If <i>For-Tanri</i> is the spider, then her flies are tightly bundled men and women, all walking the 		strings. They carry bags and sacks, from which they produce pink stones, rock after rock, only 		to place each stone at the base of each wooden post with gloved hands. They are fur clad 		farmers patiently walking the rows, sowing fist-sized seeds.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		A man lightly bundled in white sits in a cart full of pink stones. His oxen are surprisingly calm, 		and show no signs of restlessness or cold. Workers replenishing their sacs are not enduring 		the cold well as the cart driver and his animals. The chatter and blow on their hands as they 		gather at the cart to refill their bags of stone.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Why do your minstrels they work so hard for something they will never hear?" says a woman 		from behind <i>For-Tanri</i>. She turns and looks up at the speaker, a well bundled woman who's 		face cannot be seen through the thick black hair blowing free of her hood. "None of them 		are full-blooded Lios Elfar."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Enroth is. Art beckons art," says a familiar voice. <i>For-Tanri</i> glances up her right arm to 		Sonson's face, uncovered and chapped red in the winds. Sonson holds <i>For-Tanri</i>'s 		wool-mittened hand in his bare fingers. He stands between Rave and <i>For-Tanri</i> on the low hilltop. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Sonson continues, looking neither to <i>For-Tanri</i> nor the woman. "You have never known 		art, Rave. Oh, you know what it does to people. You've seen what it can make men do, and 		you have used its power in your schemes, but you have never understood. You never feel 		movement in your breast that isn't caused by a man's hand." He turns from the workers to 		face the woman. "You won't begin to understand this now, so why bother to explain?"		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"You have paid much for this to happen. Your mother wasn't happy to dismantle the 		Amphitheatre." Rave says. "She almost wished you didn't come home, to grant you such a 		request."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"It's only the top row. We'll put the stones back after. Besides, mother was plenty happy to 		see me." Sonson suddenly claps his free right hand to his forehead. "But I forget! You knew 		that. I saw how much she paid you."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Don't be bitter. You knew SOMEONE would collect the rewards. Better Mervin and me than 		someone who would get you Born Again. You made it too easy. I hear Mervin took you to 		see that Kooter woman sing--"		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Mahliya Kutura," says Sonson dryly. "Yes, Mervin's betrayal wasn't without a kiss."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Would he kiss ME then! I know men who killed to hear your Kooter woman sing. You heard 		her entire "Street Songs" in order! Mervin says afterwards he took you backstage to meet 		her." Rave's voice seems oddly pathetic to <i>For-Tanri</i>. "Is it so hard for you to see 		your mother that you would begrudge your best friends such a betrayal?" Sonson's grip on 		Tanri's mitten loosens and tightens twice but he doesn't reply.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		Seconds turn to minutes. The workers continue, the winds blow, but the hilltop is entirely still. 		Into the windy silence, Rave says, "How do these stones work anyway?"		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"They say, 'There are no bad seats in the Amphitheatre.' Have you ever seen dominoes in a 		line topple into their neighbors?" Sonson turned and waited for Rave to nod before continuing. 		"What one stone hears is sent to the next, as if each note and every word is a domino 		catapulting its neighbor outward. If this works the way I think, an elfar camped a hundred 		yards out will hear Tanri sing as if sitting beneath her." Sonson looks down at <i>For-Tanri</i> and 		sticks out his tongue. <i>For-Tanri</i> smiles back at him. "When the lios assemble, no one will be 		deaf."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"But why do you do this for a song you are forbidden to hear? Why do you demolish a ruin 		that's endured from the Cycle of Comedy? Have you somehow become fully lios elfar while 		I was away?"		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Knowing all the elves of light can hear Tanri, it will be as a pretty song for me. This is 		enough." He puts his hand on Rave's shoulder and turns the opening of her hood to face 		him. "It is enough. You know I rarely charge gold for my services. Somethings are better."		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"You are ever the fool," says Rave, leaning her head on his shoulder. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		"Then you are Fool's Gold." he says, putting his arm around her shoulder and pulling her tight. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">		<i>For-Tanri</i> releases his hand, and she departs that place in that time.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
