<h3>Trump of Wasteland</h3>
Trump are magical artifacts for communication and transportation of Trojan entities. Trump 
often appear to be as large fortune-telling cards, usually three inches by six, constructed 
of ivory, and rarely other materials. Kin of Troy pictured on the <a href="trumplist.html">Major 
Arcana</a> are known to keep their decks in boxes with their symbol on the case. However, into 
<a href="dance.html">the Cycle of Dance</a>, the Trump appear more frequently as pocket mirrors 
that Reflect images when held at certain angles.
<p>
Benevolent Kin have created a <a href="trumplist.html">list of Trump</a> that includes
descriptions as well as indicators of who is available and who is not. However, it should be
known that <a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a> maintains the definitive master
list of valid Trump. She is known to be generous to people who come to 
<a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn</a> in need of Trump decks, even non-kin.
<p>
Trump have been useful since <a href="patternfall.html">Patternfall</a> for exchange only between 
domains domains of <a href="goldcard.html">Gold Attributes</a> known to their creator
<a href="dworkin.html">Dworkin</a>:

<h3>Fiona on Trump</h3>
<i>Fri, 27 Feb 2004 13:44:57; Garret says via Trump</i>
<blockquote>Uh, thanks Fiona - are these Shadow Trump, Hell Trump, or is Family Trump something different entirely?</blockquote>
Fiona replies:
<P>Those names describe a deck of Trump of Troy by its <a href="domains.html">Dominating Archetype</a>. Various Archetypes Dominate or empower a given deck, determined by <a href="llewghund.html#aspect">Chaotic</a> local conditions at the wielder's location. Whenever Dominating Archetype <b>A &gt; 0</b>, then Trump are empowered to Reflect distant images.
<H4>Family Trump</H4>
<P>Family Trump are enforced and empowered by <a href="pattern.html">Pattern</a>/<a href="oberon.html">Oberon</a>/<a href="troad.html#aspect">Law&amp;Order</a>. Family Trump operate in all Shadows of the Pattern of Troy with effectiveness decreasing as wielder and/or Reflection approach <a href="llewghund.html">Chaos</a>.
<li><a href="compact.html">The Compact</a> ratifies Family Trump operation even against the will of the <a href="domains.html">16 Dominators</a>.
<li>It is known that <a href="kolwynia.html">Kolwynia</a>/<a href="tiresias.html">Tiresias</a> ratifies Family Trump operation across Time.
<h4>Shadow Trump</h4>
<P>Shadow Trump are enforced and empowered by <a href="dolbadarn.html">Dolbadarn<a/>/<a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a>/Ground> and perfectly operate as expected in any Shadow of the Pattern of Troy when the wielder and the Reflection touch the Ground.
<li>The Compact ratifies Shadow Trump operation even against the will of the 16 Dominators.
<li>The Trojan Pattern ratifies Shadow Trump operation even against the Compact.
<li>I believe that <a href="kolwynia.html">Kolwynia</a>/<a href="tiresias.html">Tiresias</a> ratifies Shadow Trump operation across Time.
<h4>Hell Trump</h4>
<P>Hell Trump are enforced and empowered by <a href="hell.html">Hell</a>/<a href="llyr.html">Dylan Llyr</a>/<a href="hell.html#aspect">Wrath</a>. Hell Trump are the only Trump that perfectly operate as expected in Hell and Heaven. There is no Ground in Hell, and both Heaven and Hell are without the Pattern and normal Time. It is likely <a href="melisse.html">Melisse</a> or her Wrath can befuddle Hell Trump, but Dylan hasn't confirmed this.
<li>The Compact ratifies Hell Trump operation even against the will of the 16 Dominators.

		<h3> <a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> on Trump</h3>
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		<i> Is there a way to scan who is calling you on a Trump, or can I develop a
		spell to that effect for mine? </i>
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		No known spell IDs Trumpers, but a Psionic Mind Bar can help block contact
		entirely, as can a Serten's Spell Immunity (lvl 8 mu spell). Mind Bar
		can even tell you when contact starts and what direction the Trump 
		contact comes from, if you're high enough level, Threnody's heard.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		<a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> says <a href="troy.html">Troy</a> made a Rule somewhere: anyone using Trump to attack 
		another person gets fucked. Very few people have tried attacking via Trump, 
		and all of them got burned. Ask <a href="remo.html">Remo</a>; he got a simulacrum of himself
		to attack Damion with Trump. The sim got toasted. Ask Eressea; maybe 
		she knows more about that aspect of the Trump from her days in The 
		Courts of Chaos.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		<a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> thinks Brand got his ass toasted by attacking one of his 
		brothers through the Trump. When was the last time anyone ever saw 
		Brand? He used to eb 119th level. Now Fiona's 119th and Brand's only
		18 or 28 or so.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		Unfortunately, there is no way to block Trump contact without blocking all 
		magic of that nature with a blanket immunity or protection. You would need
		an 8th level spell in order to block Trump contact. This means you would
		have to be 16th level magic user to do the research, or cast it from a 
		scroll that someone else researched and made.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		You may wish to seek <a href="morgan.html">Morgan la Faye</a> or Fiona on this topic. These two 
		are noted for their examination of Trump. Also Brand, Bleys, and possibly
		Corwin's son Merlyn are said to have spent some time studying Trump.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		And of course, Tanngrisnir would know everything Dworkin did.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		<h3>tanngrisnir on Trump</h3>
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		There was no spell for detecting or blocking Trump. The spell PORTAL was
		used to make them. Portal is a ninth level spell which is the reverse of 
		GATE. Portal allows one to initiate contact in order to procure an invitation,
		after which enabled transportation. People noticed how powerful communication
		can be and made the Trump useful for that purpose more often than for
		their intended purpose of transportation.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		'Communication was found to include visual, psionic, and audio information.
		Trump could pierce certain protections and traps in order to permit the
		people to escape or to talk despite the defenses intervening between the 
		involved parties.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		Morgan La faye made a spell to guard against Trump contact, but Tan
		never saw a spellbook page to be able to describe its operation.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		If you use the Trump for attack, you will be punished. Punishment is always
		"sufficient to cause regret." One would imagine that using a Trump to attempt
		a morganti attack would involve instantaneous or pre-emptive retribution;
		however, historically punishment has invariably been meted _after_ the attack 
		is complete (regardless of success or failure). No one known has dared to test 
		this theory about instant rehabilitation for Morganti-Trump attack.
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		None of the punished persons has been talkative about his or her rehabilitation.
		When <a href="remo.html">Remo</a> used one of his assassins to attack Damion through Trump, <a href="remo.html">Remo</a> became 
		mirrored seventy seven thousand times in lesser, embarrassingly imperfect 
		simulacrums on every shadow of Troad. Brand was similarly humbled on ongoing 
		terms, when he lost his primacy to Fiona; Fiona became the Original Princess,
		and Brand became a second-generation Prince of Ilium. 
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		It's also improper to mess with anyone's card but your own. If Chrys were to
		usurp Eresseas Trump and have it instead contact someone else, there'd be
		hell to pay when <a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a> objected to it. Rumour has it that's why some
		members of the family are no longer in favour (Brand, Fiona, Bleys, Hal).
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		However, it's never been against Troy's will to trap your own card. You 
		could do anything you like to someone who uses the Trump to contact you.
		Chrysofar could set up an automatice-Dusting-no-save of anyone who contacts 
		Chrys via Trump. Tangrisner thinks that Chrys would enrage <a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> if she did 
		this, but Chrysofar would not be abusing the Trump to do so. 
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		This is essentially <a href="troy.html">Troy</a> made certain people could get around any punishment 
		for being in a bad place where receiving Trump contact initiated by someone 
		else draws someone else into danger. "People who contact you by your Trump
		are placing themselves in your power," says Tan. "You did not invite their
		contact, so the initiator gets any danger, not you."
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		The bottom line. You don't mess with anyone else's card, and that includes attacking.
		"You will live to regret it."
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		<h3><a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> on Dreaming and Trump</h3>
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		collect the soul of their pictured creature rather than allow it to receive
		the Real Death. This worked against the Morganti'd person Colbart. 
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		The minor arcana are not all able to reach the person pictured, either
		because of (a) powerful magic aquired after the Trump was painted, or (b) the
		pictured person place or thing no longer exists. Morganti death is not
		protected against in the minor arcana, except perhaps from Dolkris, because
		it is now pictured on Erin's card (<a href="threnody.html">Threnody</a> bows).
		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">
		Trump can allow a person to observe another's dreams, or even awaken a
		sleeper or put a non-sleeping person to sleep.
