Thrint tore Inspiration from the minds of their slaves, but neverconsumed the brains as Mind Flayers do.Thrints had poor coordination and worse imagination. in addition to Dominatingraces for Inspiration, they enslaved imaginative artificer races, such as themoties, Jaenshi, Mitheranean, and Atheleni to make tools for enhancing Thrintdomination over the physical world. no chance exists to meet a random Thrint. the Thrint are known to Githyankiand Githzerai, as well as the Mitheraneans, Atheleni, and the few remainingJaenshi.to this day a chance exists to meet Sleeth within the Ether and on the AstralPlanes. Sleeth never dominated slaves themselves, but rather appeared at oddintervals in raids to feed on the slaves of other slaveraces. >What does one do to a Thrint?show him the soles of your shoes as you run away.the Thrint is a mithril rank creature like all slaveraces. mithril rankcreatures can ignore Domination from non-mithril rank creatures, however,a chance exists for a weaker creature to Invoke the Dominance of at leasta +4 physical weapon and/or 8th level spell. >If I run into one, am I screwed, or would I be able to affect a>probability, like a saving throw, for instance?alone, Morin would be pretty much in the category of screwed. to modifythe Thrint Attack die roll, Morin would have to find a <a href="knock.html">Knock</a> artifact orbecome mithril rank or better. Thrint enslavement attack = flat save with no modifiers: roll a 13 or higheron a d20 or your mind is enslaved. no known psionics or mental device/disciplinecan modify the save or make one immune to the Thrint.because gith have NATURAL racial ability of probability travel, a mithrilMorin would be able to use his dice in defense to travel to a plane inwhich the Thrint did not dominate Morin. NOTE WELL: a mithril rank Morinwould be unable to defend a non-mithril rank companion with Morin'sprobability travel.within Worlorn, a flat 13 save is usually a Knock effect. Knock was one ofthe Dominator personalities arriving in the <a href="comedy.html">first Cycle of Inspiration</a>,under the Muse of Comedy. if the Thrints were Dominated by Knock, then achance exists that a Knock artifact could Dominate a Thrint. Knock artifactsfall in two categories: <a href="goldcard.html">gold cards</a> and <a href="dragonbones.html">dragonbones</a>.		</font>	</pre>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1999 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>		all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img height=15 width=15 border="0" src="../images/arrow_up.gif" alt="top"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
