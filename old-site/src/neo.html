The morning air			was bitterly cold and the sun would be a welcome sight to the inhabitants of Snowkeep			as they arose from what seemed to be a long winters sleep. Across the fallen snow,			the shadows of large birds of prey danced eerily across the peaks of the glistening			mountains. A solitary cloaked figure on horseback slowly trudged through the deep			snow, riding towards Mount Windsong, the tallest peak in all of <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a>. The ride			had been a long one and the figure would not reach the summit until the sun became			one with the Great Sea in the west.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			At the summit of Mount Windsong lay a circlet of 36 white stones some 10 meters			high, perfect and evenly dispersed. In the center of the shrine set an empty			throne. The ornate throne was immense, reaching almost 20 feet at its highest			point. The fleeting light danced in and out of the shrine, glistening off small			flecks of various metals embedded deep with the stones as the figure slowly			dismounted his steed and made camp.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			By now, the full moon of <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a> was shining its light down across the valleys			below. The figure took a deep breath of the cold air, filling his lungs until			they surely were about to explode. The figure held the air within his body as			long a possible until his lungs burned with the pain of the frigid air. As he			slowly exhaled, the ensuing mist from his breath created a cold fog amongst the			inner sanctum of the stones. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Slowly, the figure began to walk around the shrine, touching each stone as			if remembering something from long days since past. The key stones to the			north, south, east, and west held a small, oval opening about one-third			of a meter high in their base. As the figure past each keystone, he reached			into four separate pouches and placed an oval rune stone in each of the			openings. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“RUNE … the power of the stars.”		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The figure paused. He remembered how war between <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a> and <a href="troy.html">Troy</a> had almost			erupted over the power of the stones he now placed into the shrine. He paused			and looked up, as if waiting to see if war would again be threatened; but			there no threat this night -- only the stars glistening like a million			snowflakes through the crisp winter air. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The figure slowly ascended his throne finally resting on a seat large enough			for a titan or dragon. The figure carefully removed his hood revealing his			long flowing hair that flowed like waves across an endless ocean in the			cool breeze.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The figure ran his finger over an ancient rune of many names, finally resting			on the name of A. S. SILVERBLADE. He smiled for a moment, as if remembering			a since long, forgotten name. Removing the final rune stone, he placed it			into the scepter of the throne. For a moment, the very stars in the heavens			seemed to dim under the power that now flowed from the shrine.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“Now Theseus.” The words had been barely audible as the veil of total and			utter Sanctuary surrounded the mountain shrine. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			The figure on the throne was now revealed—he was			<a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a>, the ArchAngel, Son, and King.	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475">		<font face="helvetica, helv, arial" size="+2">Chapter 2</font>	</td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475">		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			It had long been known that peridot could not existing within <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a>. Sages			had long pondered the question of how this paradox had come to be. Some had			hypothesized that it was to prevent secrets from coming into <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a>. Others			had suggested only the opposite. The absence of peridot prevented the			secrets of <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a> from being unlocked and falling into the wrong hands.			Whatever the reason, the sages seemed to agree that the secrets of Mestea			were some of the most closely guarded secrets in the world.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> set upon his throne, harnessing the very power of the stars that had			been his birthright. The tide and ebb of the utter power intermingled with			the calming power of absolute sanctuary. Reaching out, power and sanctuary			sought an entity long forgotten in the annals of time. When they found her,			the power and sanctuary surrounded them both … bonding them together, each			aware of the other -- not as an attack, but as a gentle touch not unlike a			soft, unheard whisper. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“Clio, <a href="muses.html">Muse</a> of <a href="history.html">History</a>, I call			to you and beseech you to listen to the tale			of a lost dreamer, for it is a tale that shakes the very foundation of all			I know.” The thoughts of <a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> reached out to the <a href="muses.html">Muse</a>.			After a pause of accepting silence, <a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> continued with his tale.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“Yesterday, an entity arrived in <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a>. How this			entity entered and left			remains a mystery but his visit has shaken our world. The stranger requested			and found an audience with Theseus, something thought to be impossible. We			didn&#146;t know whether to kill him or listen to him. We decided to listen.”		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Again <a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> paused, for a moment wondering if he was just a fool speaking			to himself. Again, accepting silence caused him to think otherwise.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“This stranger claimed he was an inspired creature of Clio…The			<a href="muses.html">Muse</a> of History.”		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> pause. Silence.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“This figure, claimed that he was the Alpha and that you were the Omega … a			riddle that we yet to understand. He called himself Neo, a thief or ‘hacker&#146;.			This Neo claimed that an entity named Morpheus-Q had freed him from his prison			and that now, he was here to free us. He claimed the dreamers and dancers had			had their chance but could never achieve what they sought to discover.”		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Again <a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> paused for a reply that never came. He fought to maintain the			link as the nervousness and fear fought to overtake him. Maintaining his			control, <a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> continued the tale. 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“Theseus ask Neo what he was trying to free us from.

Of which			there have been five cycles of games. Each cycle was sponsored by one of			the five <a href="muses.html">Muses</a>, each taking turns in the cycle, each bringing a new			game to her people. Same game, new rules. Each cycle saw the rise of			blood and the fall of dust and so the Worlorn world was born.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			<a href="niteblade.html">Niteblade</a> continued.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			“Theseus had watched with amusement and bewilderment as the figure known			as Neo spun his web. He claimed that dreamers and dancers were living in			a fantasy world and that if only their eyes and minds could be opened,			they would see everything. He had claimed that within this New World,			there was room for all. He said, 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			”History does repeat itself.” 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			An annoying chirping ring echoing in the hall broke the silence between Theseus			and Neo at that moment. Neo reached into his coat and pulled a small black			object that read “Nokia” on it and placed it to his ear. His only words			had been “OK” as he stuffed his items back into his backpack. His final			words to Theseus were, “Ask yourself. What is the Matrix? When you can			answer that question, all of this will make blinding sense.” 		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			Then the figure known as Neo departed <a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a> with unheard of speed and agility.		<p><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">			It was only then that Theseus realized why.
