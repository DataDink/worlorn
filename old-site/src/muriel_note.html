Simon sends Crimson tofind twenty different things.you see, this guy Simon is walking in this magical maze called the Pattern.it's a weird Hall of Mirrors. there are twenty special magic mirrors showingtwenty special reflections. each time Simon sees a special kind of magicmirror, the hobbit dude Crimson has to find the place the mirror views,and see it for real. like you know when the evil queen says, "mirror mirror on the wall, who'sthe fairest one of all?" then her mirror, it like, talks back to the evilqueen, proves he's a peeping tom on sleeping beauty or snow white or whateverchick? well, Simon's twenty magic mirrors see more than just the twenty hottestchicks. Simon's mirrors also see the twenty most studly beefcakes, andmore: twenty best vacation hot spots, and twenty killer wicked swords, and alot of other sets of twenty best-of-the-bunch kinds of things. all these twenty places and swords and hunks are all outside the Hall ofMirrors, and some are WAY FAR away, so Crimson dude has a lot of groundto cover in order to see them at the same time Simon sees them in themirror.but this Crimson dude, he doesn't, like, know about the hot chicks orstudly hunks, and he's just learning about the vacation spots. so farall Crimson dude really knows about for sure is twenty honking deadlymorganti swords, one is a part of each mirror. so instead of vacationingin the 20 coolest beaches and touring the 20 most neato castles of theworld, this Crimson hobbit dude is spending all his time like trackingdown the 20 wicked swords and hoping none of them get stuck in his heart.you know? anyways, the bad shit hits the fan if Simon gets to one of them MagicMirrors and Crimson's not out there seeing with his naked eyes what thespecial mirror reflects. if this happens then Simon's mirror ... trapsSimon inside. forever. well, a long time. real long time. nearly forever.and when he gets out, he's pissed.so if Simon is trapped, then he won't be able to save the world from thearmy of Illithids. you know, Illithids, those yukki things that ate thebrains of the Crimson Hobbit Dude, and those two other unlucky dudes thatwere hanging around the wrong place at the wrong time when i sent you tospy for me last Halloween.so for this Halloween, like, i'll send you out again to help them find oneof the worstest of the bad ass killer wicked swords. Halloween is a verybad time to look for these morganti swords; just to keep them safe, soi'll let you take along a can of whup-ass, and when the going gets tough,you take out that can, drink it down, and then you can whup-ass on who everbad guys stand in your way.Kapish? greater princess of the evil drow devils,your queen,ThrenodyP.S. great buns on that bartender; good choice. At 04:54 PM 10/3/99 -0700, Muriel wrote:>Hiya gal,>        So what is this hobbit dude up to? and why in the hell is he trying>to bother me while I'm on VACAY?
