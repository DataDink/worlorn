He was weeping and smiling, so at first the sisters who know of the faerie expected some trick was about to befall us all, and they smiled and looked within for strength.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;But then, hear me, this Faerie, although he refused to speak, did no harm. Weeping all the while, he permitted us to heal him of the Faerie sickness, the kin curse, the Plague of  withering. He seemed amused, but aided the sisters to preserve  his life. When asked about his tears he would only shake his  head and shut his eyes, and tremble from his grief. We could  not inflict such pain, so they stopped asking. The sisters cured the blisters from his feet and the hunger from his belly,  but we could only put a pillow beneath his head. Sleep did not  stop his tears, but in fact freed his voice to cry out loud.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Forgive me mother, for saying the name, but the faerie man  cried for &#145;<i>Isis</i> [to] <i>preserve</i> [him],&#146; and &#145;<i>oh my friend</i>,&#146; and I am told once he said, &#145;<i>what is the pleasure if the sacrifice costs our most vast potential</i>?&#146; The faerie man slept only that once in the fortnight he has been among us.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;From the next morning this faerie man followed the sisters and brothers of the order from shrine to shrine within the lands of Dolbadarn, for a fortnight helping them preserve the Eressene  way among the people of Dolbadarn. He continued to hold silence even when one of the brothers noticed the Faerie man held a staff which would not burn or break under duress. Then one of the  brothers noticed the clasp on his robes, and they brought him to me. he did not resist, but he clearly was not pleased.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Good Mother, I saw him and I knew his staff, his clasp, and his  robes from my own pathways of healing. We have a mage of <a href="roke.html">Roke Island</a>  among us, weeping. I made as if to touch him, and he  withdrew from me, revealing an amulet like unto my own, but  serving another <b>Power</b>. Grey Lord preserve us, but I might  have used the Stone against the will of its sister's weilder!<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Mother, he opened his mouth and spoke your name as if he did not  expect you to be here, or even alive. I told him Troy&#146;s power has preserved you and Dolbadarn through all the tribulations,  and this Faerie man, he smiled through his tears, and wiped his eyes, and asked me to take me to you.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">&#147;Also he asked me if you had &#145;<i><i>preserved his sword for him throughout these empty years</i></i>.&#146; Do you know what he means, what horrible sword  could make a faerie man weep so to be without it?&#148;<br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><h3>Subject: Visitor to Damon Maker's Court</h3></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="475"><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">An exquisite magic item comes visiting Damon Maker under it'sown power. This thing appears to be a merging of an Elf'ssimulacrum and an artifact of PRESERVATION, being an artifactof such power the only thing Damon Maker can compare it to is Threnody's Star of Fire. This must be a Star of Preservation.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">It is Proected against being wielded, by the Heart of the Earthartifact, as well as the Burial of the Dead artifact. Looks likethe simulacrum has done well to keep itself preserved from foolishpossession from others. This simulacrum appears to be halfwayto making itself a real elf. It will have to de-protect the Star of Preservation before it becomes a real elf, or itwill lose the Star. The Simulacrum appears to have this allunder control. It's a fascinating creation, apparently self-made...<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">It speaks when it has finally achieved Damon Maker's presence:<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">"It is my purpose to inform you so that with knowledge you maywork with Eressea to assist the Deathgod.
