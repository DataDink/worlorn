I would like to offer restorative/resurrection capacities, butmy only ability is in wishes and psionic healing for which I must be present. I would like to set up a benevolent organization and would appreciate yourassistance. If it would not be asking too much, perhaps you could use yourability to resurrect if I am unable, or if it would be more convenient than awish(to whom I know not who the wishes currently appeal). Please let me knowif you are interested in participating.<P><font size=4><b>Date: Sun, 30 Apr 1995 10:59:50 -0400</b></font><P>Elfhome has a new popularity as sanctuary for those with elfar blood. Thereturn of the founder of Elfhome has reduced the martial emphasis on thevilalge and transferred the focus back to the original sanctuary it startedas. The non-holdfast Kav Elfar make best use if Elfhome as a hometown, forthey have no other place since the fall of Castle Black into the Sea.<P>The Shanagate Holdfast kethi are notably enthusiastic about peopling Erin'sElfhome with non-aggressive Holdfast brotherhood. With their support, Elfhomeremains a place for kethi to congregate, despite Irinjade Holdfast'swithdrawal to a man. Every other holdfasts participate, even the little seenKenn and Taal. The little-known ultra-conservative Taal Holdfast kethi (markof the horse) sent a party for permanent residence, showing up one day ridingtheir legendary spirit-horses.<P>The Khan sends Order of the Equestrian emissaries as soon as the word of Taalgets out. Appearance of the Taal could be a _large_ coup in Manchurian-Elfhome cooperation. No Khansman has seen a Taal spirit horse since The Great Timujin burned the forests of Fleeter, and the covens withdrew in protest.<P><font size=4><b>From TroyOunces@aol.com Sat May 13 19:27:57 1995<br>Subject: blessed are the peacemakers</b></font><P>The Great Khan Tigris grants an audience to The Great Lord Erin, and is seento be deeply moved by Erin's speech of friendship and brotherhood. He claspsErin's arm and hand in friendship before he retires, an action which some saywill create enemies for the Khan within his own court. <P>One advisor is heard to say "I trust him," and the Khan himself is heardmuttering with disbelief in a drinking house that evening, "No wonder theHoldfasts call him "Betrayer."<P><center>***</center><P>The Taal, upon hearing the tale of Khan Tigris and Lord Erin immediatelyestablish permanent quarters at Elfhome. Taal Holdfast Equestrian RidingSchool Inc. is established before Erin returns from Isuame, almost outsideElfhome city limits, where a human presence would not insult ANY kethi, even the Braith. <P>The Taal Holdfast teachers do things no man has seen before, leaping fromhorse to horse, making pyramids of kethi at the speeds of the wind. None sitsa saddle when he rides. They offer to teach "any who come to study in thepeace of Erin." Khannish samurai and other horsemen flock to the call. <P>"Erin's peace" becomes a common catch phrase heard often in Elfhome,  less and less often with Irony. <ul><li><a href="erin.html">erin the fan</a></ul></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=4>missing something you want to see?</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><A href="mailto:worlorn-webmaster@gadzikowski.com"><i>tell me!</i></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	</tr><tr>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="right" height="25" width="475"><font size=-3>this page copyright &copy; 1997&#150;1998 mark gilbert gadzikowski<br>all rights reserved</font></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td>	<td valign="top" align="left" height="25" width="75"><a href="#top"><img border=0 src="../images/arrow_up.gif"></a></td>	<td valign="top" align="center" height="25" width="25"><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
