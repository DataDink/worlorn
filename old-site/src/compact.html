<P>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">So far my 'rules that counteract your abilities to survive' have averted the following crisis situations without loss of Dreams:
<ol>
<li><a href="troad.html">New Troad</a> from a 8:2 attack from <a href="daortwen.html">Daort Wen</a>. No Kin of Troy should use ANY mirror in D-State from now on for fear of opposition.
<li><a href="crosswinds.html">Crosswinds</a> from a 4:2 attack from the vicinity of the South Pole. Looked like a <a href="game.html">Blood/Dust thing</a> for sure.
<li><a href="watersea.html">Watersea</a> from a 4:1 attack from Elidor. Something you need to tell me, Tiresias? Time was I trusted you...
<li><a href="elidor.html">Elidor</a> from a 17:4 attack of indeterminate origin. Something you need to tell me, Tiresias? (Deja Vu)
<li><a href="mestea.html">Mestea</a> from a 3:1 attack from Typhon-S. (I know. Typhon-S? It's <b>not</b> Typhon who is Skagganutt's Master the Dark Horse that we all know and love. Typhon-S appeared similar to Darkness, the immense sentient evil Dragon from Knock).
<li><a href="lakedreams.html">Lake of Dreams</a> from 20 or 28 separate 2:1 attacks from Voidcastle. Could have been a veiled attack from <a href="oberon.html">Oberon</a>'s Pattern.
<li><a href="skagganutt.html">Skagganutt</a> from a 2:1 attack from Carsultyl. Well of Time & Hell appeared to have torn two wathan from the Abyss. <a href="prince1000.html">Dylan Llyr</a> appears to have been involved as victim or perpetrator, with high-probability he and Melisse were escaping Typhon Noir's prison for the Dancing lands outside Oimota's Dominion.
<li>All <a href="dominions.html">Oimota's 16 Dominions</a> from complete Domination by the Shadow Lands. DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANYTHING MISSING FROM YOUR TURFS TO <a href="niteblade.html">NITEBLADE</a>; THIS IS NOT A JOKE!

<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">I suppose I could have mentioned all this danger and weakness explicitly earlier, but we have a Blood Dancer among <a href="dominions.html">Oimota's 16 Dominators</a>, and I didn't want to reveal how little we Dust Dreamers knew. Now the universe knows what a corner we're stuck in. I'm so happy to come clean with you all in public.<br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">We are under attack by DANCERS, by Blood forces, both iakhlu and er per'henne. We are D&D characters holding out in a Rolemaster universe. There is a fixed amount of D&D Dream experience in the universe, and Dancers want to turn it into Rolemaster EP. You think you can do better without my D&D laws in the Compact, then please write me into your will and testament BEFORE you go out there and try to run under RoleMaster laws. <br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Wake up! There are over a dozen gold cards out there trying to Dance all us Dreamers to death, and at least one traitor Blood Dancing among Oimota's 16 Dominators. Haven't you noticed the black web pages on your oracle machines? DUST DREAMERS ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF THOSE RULES! BLOOD DANCERS ARE STARING TO DICTATE TO DREAMERS AND WE HAVE ONLY THE BOOK OF THE NEW DAY TO SUSTAIN US!<br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">We are <a href="dreams.html">Dreamers</a> in a <a href="dance.html">Dancing</a> Universe. When was the last time you saw a <a href="history.html">Historian</a> or <a href="astronomy.html">Astronomer</a>? They are dead. Dead Dead Dead. No ressurrection. We Dreamers killed the last one less than fifty years before she would have made Poet of Dreams; Luces morganti'd Dark Agnes without giving a damn that she was the last Historian. And now the Blood Dancers have forty-four hundred years to do the same to us.<br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">But the Blood Dancers aren't indifferent to Dust Dreamers like Blood Dreamers were to Dust Historians; no we're not that lucky. The Weilder of the Muse of Dance was trained as a grandfather assassin and now hates our fucking guts. <br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The Master of the Dance is single-mindedly out to eliminate every Dreamer using The Real Death. All Dreamers are on the Dancing universe's hit list. We each have a black decade ten-morganti assassination contract out on us, but they won't stop trying to kill us if the first ten assassinations fail. imagine a black googol, and then start watching your back. <br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">If the Compact had been written by a Blood Dancer, there would be no Dust Dreamers in it; no <a href="troad.html">Troad</a>, no <a href="eressea.html">Eressea</a>, no D&D. There would be no D&D places or D&D people, not one name that Dreamers had ever heard before except for Terpsichore, and maybe Klinure off in a footnote somewhere. <br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">I can't believe what I'm hearing. Wake up Dreamers! We are has-beens and our names are on the post office wall. Blood Dancers have already carved our names on tombstones. <br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">Under my command we have two/thirds of the gold cards still with Dust Dreamers. If a Dancer had collected the Book of The New Day before I got to it, undoubtedly there would be a Rule that no D&D character can weild ANY kind of carded item. Imagine fucking that, and then go tell me you want to break the Compact. I'll kill you myself.<br>
<img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">I'll cut you all loose, every last one of you, before I let anything endanger Dust Dreamer control of the Dancing Compact. You won't have the chance to ask twice.<br>

Fellow Archetypes of Worlorn:
<P><We are wasting time reflecting on issues we cannot change,
while ignoring issues which could become irrevocable curses.
<P>
The wisdom to know the difference<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<P>
Some Archetypes appear to misunderstand the Compact. I'm 
flabbergasted that those who helped write the Sixth and 
Seventh Compacts are equally confused as the newcomers.
<P>This Compact is an agreement that [what we have now at 
our disposal] will not be taken away by any of us when 
we travel outside our Turfs. The Codex of the Infinite 
Planes empowers our agreement not to subtract; it has 
never empowered unavailable magical aspects or attributes. 
<P>
If you cannot already raise an Aspect or wield an Attribute,
The Book of the New Day won't empower you to command that Aspect 
or Attribute in the Wasteland. If you do not possess an Aspect or 
Attribute while in the Wasteland, don't ask other Turfholders 
to empower your whimsy while visiting our turfs.
<P>
I see addendums and modifications which have no foundation 
in the current abilities of ANY of us. Don't bother discusing 
aspects and attributes none of us possess--it's a waste of 
time. No matter how much we'd like to have the Book of the 
New Day bring back our morganti victims, it ain't gonna 
appear in The Book of the New Day unless one of us can 
already do it and all eight of us agree not to block that 
power when it happens in our turf.
<P>
Get real. No matter how much we would like to give ourselves 
and our friends power, we (or our friends) must already possess 
the powers we ratify. Wishful thinking requires a power source 
to manifest that will. I will not ratify unprecedented and
unfounded Aspects/Attributes, and neither will the Compact.
<P>
To change the thing we can<br>
--------------------------<br>
<P>
Editing the Compact should focus on four issues:
<ol>
<li> what to remove of previous inconvenient Aspects and 
  Attributes based on void or defunct archetypes.
<li> what current Aspects and attributes you have the 
  power to add;
<li> leveraging items (1) and (2) against other turfholders;
<li> how to deal with Aspects and Attributes appearing 
  in the Book of the New Day outside of our powers to veto.
</ol>
Is no one but me confounded by di Griz' interference? 
He Voided the Seventh Compact and replaced it with whimsy.
How? It ain't the Hellflame. It ain't his Roke training.
Someone like five Kos or something like five Runestaffs
empowered one entity to spuriously Void the plans of
four wild magics controlling five Worlorn Thrones! 
Shouldn't we be examining how the Compact sustained 
di Griz' will so that no one substitutes another 
Compact for our finely crafted Book of the New Day?
<p>
Is no one but me concerned by the North Pole's attempts to
sustain nine turfs under the Compact of the New Day? Shouldn't
we be addressing turf quantities with addendums to prevent 
nine turfs from falsifying our Compact?
<P>
Is no one but me terrified that we have a pair of Sentients 
ready to become ratified as turfholders in New Troad and 
Llewghund? Shouldn't six of us be discussing this in 
relation to all vetoes and ratifications addressed by 
'Tanngrisnir' and 'Almitra Almustafa'? Or should I say
'Tloluvin' and 'Reb'?
<P>
Is no one but me powerless to generate dreams for the 
Wasteland under either Dust Law or Blood Law? After all,
the Book of the New Day appears to be a Compact under 
the Muse of DREAMS? Mightn't this be fixed by whoever 
has the Sustained Attractor 'Muse of Dreams' speaking 
up and making an entry in the Compact? Should not we
find the Muse and enter accessability into the Compact for
this cycle instead of depending on a few lines from
the last Compact?
<P>
Pardon my hasty opinion, but at face value these four
issue seem less-trivial matters than the drivel taking 
up column inches in the proposed edits. We don't have 
the liberty to waste time discussing sporting goods, folks.
<P>
