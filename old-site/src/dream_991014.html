Ryndall is joined by his Er'perhenne MolonNightingale. Crimson's expected Er'perhenne Vlad Petros is not present,having been called away on some personal business (recruiting areplacement for a recent vacancy in his organization). When Crimsoncomments on some wounds sustained in the previous Crossing In The Mist,<i>Er'perhenne</i> <a href="maja.html">Maja Barusse</a> appears and heals him.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The party discusses how best to deal with the next Veil, and debateswhether to first detour to rescue the Er'perhenne Faella from what theybelieve is "demon possession".  The general consensus (with somereluctance by Crimson) is that the Veil must come first, or all thatFaella was striving for would be in vain. Kiera proposes a plan thatmight complete the entire Patternwalk in only one or two Crossings, andRyndall suggests an enhancement that might save Faella too. Just as theyare preparing to leave the Estate, the Iakhlu Derek awakens and joins. The party (Iakhlu and Molon) takes to the winds to travel to the docksof Port Suame.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">When they arrive, they see The Midnight Myst still/again docked in aberth. Along with the Er'perhenne captain and crew is the Iakhlu Minni,who is an avatar generated from Llewghund. Minni calls Crimson"Stretch", and bears Faella's sword. Crimson, Ryndall, and Molon areprevented by the ship captain from boarding, as they are accused by thecaptain of abandoning Faella in her hour of need. Crimson tells his sideof the story, and says that he is working on saving Faella, if the partyis given passage to Castle Murias on Elidor. The Er'perhenne captainlooks at the Iakhlu Minni, and seeing that she seems favorably disposedtowards Crimson's plea, assents. Crimson, Ryndall, and Molon are allowedon board, and the ship sails to Elidor. <br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The ship arrives at the base of a cliff in fog, and the partydisembarks. The captain says that they will not be given passage backwithout proof of Faella's rescue. The party ascends the cliff in thewind, and notes the signpost "Murias" next to the entrance to thecastle. (Ryndall notes a familiar-looking tree growing on the other sideof the path.) All the Iakhlu touch the walls of the castle, followed bythe Er'perhenne Molon.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">There is some renewed debate about the plan, but eventually allparty-members end their adventure.

Ryndall is joinedby his Er'perhenne Molon Nightingale. Kiera begins the adventure withthe Eye of Timor (which she hands to Minni), the Jade Cauldron (whichshe hands to Ryndall), the Talking Sword of Lothia (which she hands toDerek), and the Spear Illdana (which she hands to Crimson). She explainsthat each must take their item to the proper place in one of the fourCastles, whereupon she will Dance in the proper place in the center ofthe Island. With no random nor non-random encounters, and with thedistribution of Ryndall's food and water, the setup is successfullyperformed.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"><a href="kolwynia_kiera.html">Kiera invokes the Key That Was Lost 20 times</a>.<br><img width="25" height="1" src="../images/xparent.gif" alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">The party ends safely in Saltpeter's Estate, with Iakhlu Crimson Gray,Kiera, Derek, Minni, and Ryndall, along with Ryndall's Er'perhenne MolonNightingale and Crimson's Er'perhenne Faella.
